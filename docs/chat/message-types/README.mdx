# Intro to Message Types
Each message of Push Chat is a json payload that carries with it a message type. This message type helps in determining what content is getting sent (Text, Images, Replies, etc) and allows Push SDK to decrypt and display them accordingly.

Push Chat supports an evergrowing list message types, all of which can be sent by `PushAPI.chat.send`, though some require passing few additional parameters.
