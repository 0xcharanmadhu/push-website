# Contribute to Push DAO

There are several levels of participation on the Push DAO.
You have the flexibility to contribute as little or as much as you prefer.

Stay informed about DAO activities by following us through our communication channels:

Push DAO Twitter for updates
Joining our Discord community to explore contribution opportunities
Engage in discussions about governance proposals in the Forum.

These programs are accessible to initiate your path towards becoming an actively involved contributor within Push DAO.

### PUSH Grantsssss

The focus of this program is on empowering a wider network of developers and other contributors to lend their time and talents toward the advancement and adoption of the PUSH protocol.

A grand total of $1,000,000 USD from the community treasury was allocated to initiate the program in Q1/2022. Push Grants Program is presently in the process of transitioning into a community-driven subDAO.

To learn more about the PUSH PUSH Grants Program, please refer to the official announcement [blog post](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/push-grants-program-its-here-f2bfba29388f) and the [Official Push Grants notion site](https://pushprotocol.notion.site/Push-Grants-Program-8c9f7934f7e5418faf96e7a5bdcaac4a)

### Push Ambassadors Program

The Ambassadors program is a unique initiative that allows individuals to represent Push in different ways. Being an ambassador is not just about promoting the brand, but it is also about building relationships with users and potential collaborators. Ambassadors are encouraged to engage with different communities, listen to their feedback, and provide valuable insights to Push. This feedback helps Push to improve its products or services and build a better user experience.

Eager to become a Push DAO Ambassador? Participate in our bi-weekly public ceremonies for the Globalization subDAO on Push Discord.
