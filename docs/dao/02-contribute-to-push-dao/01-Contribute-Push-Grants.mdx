# Push Grants Program

The focus of this program is on empowering a wider network of developers and other contributors to lend their time and talents toward the advancement and adoption of the PUSH Protocol Ecosystem.

A grand total of $1,000,000 USD from the community treasury was allocated to initiate the program in Q1/2022. Push Grants Program is presently in the process of transitioning into a community-driven subDAO.

In addition to establishing a structure for effectively managing a grants program, we've also developed a support system to assist grantees in achieving success with their projects.

**Demo Thursdays** serves as an excellent platform for applicants to present their ideas to our community.

**Push Pals** is a bi-weekly publication designed to highlight the achievements of Push grantees.

And of course, the **Push Ambassadors** are ever ready to step in and provide assistance to grantees in their endeavors and campaigns.
