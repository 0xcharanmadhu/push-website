# The Proposal Phase

The Proposal phase may be considered as the initial step towards the governance journey.

For any proposal to be accepted and executed for PUSH Governance, the initial proposer needs to submit their proposal on the [Governance Proposal](https://gov.push.org/c/governance-proposals/8) Forum with the rules mentioned below.

Note: _This is a Discourse-hosted forum for governance-related discussion. Community members must register for an account before participating. Proposals on the forum must be submitted following a template._

### Submitting a Draft Proposals

- Users need to post a new proposal draft under [Governance Proposals](https://gov.push.org/c/governance-proposals/8).
- During this stage, we are in the process of incubating ideas, and the community is welcome to participate by sharing their opinions or proposing adjustments. This occurs prior to the ideas progressing into formal proposals.

- Topics/Posts/Replies with low information or inappropriate content will be ruthlessly moderated.

- Draft proposals are then promoted to the [Governance Discussions](https://gov.push.org/c/governance-discussions/5) section provided they meet the promotion criteria mentioned below.

### What are the Promotion Criteria?

Proposals from the Governance Proposals section to the Governance Discussion section if they meet the following criteria:

- Must be submitted under [Governance Proposal](https://gov.push.org/c/proposals-lobby/8) section

- Must be live for 5+ days

- Must have 5 Likes (minimum)

_Note: The rules of governance (meta-governance) are also the subject of governance and thus can be changed following the due process._
