# Introduction to Push Governance

A brief of overview of the Progressive Decentralized Governance of PUSH.

The first step toward the Progressive Decentralized Governance was taken on 16th September 2021 with the successful launch of PUSH Governance Phase ZERO.

The initial phases of PUSH Governance allowed our community to vote and participate in three ways:

**Grants Program:** allocating grants to teams, projects, and initiatives across the ecosystem that are helping build around the PUSH ecosystem. The grant funds will come from the $PUSH Community Allocation.

**Weekly Rockstar NFTs:** currently running the second season - each week (starting April 19th, 2021), community members who continue to help us on our mission to bring Push Protocol to the Web3 are airdropped an NFT along with a bag of $PUSH tokens. Recipients of this NFT are also eligible to join the Rockstars of PUSH protocol Token Gated Channel on our Discord and get access to exclusive content before everyone else. Voting for the recipient is part of the governance process.\*\*

**Meta-Governance:** token holders can pass and vote on measures affecting how the PUSH governance evolves past phase 0.

It must be noted that the current governance participation mechanisms are the initial stages of PUSH governance. However, as the protocol matures, PUSH Governance will further decentralize and include more categories giving the community more power over the protocol.

## Governance Roles

There are 3 crucial roles in PUSH governance:

**PUSH Nominee:** Active community members who strongly support the vision of PUSH can nominate themselves to be a PUSH Nominee. $PUSH token holders can then choose to delegate their voting rights to any Push Nominee, who can vote on governance proposals through Snapshot.

**PUSH Delegatee:** PUSH Delegatees are active members of the community who have at least 75,000 $PUSH delegated to them. They will be able to create proposals on Snapshot that are approved on the forum. To delegate your voting power to a PUSH Delegatee, to another person, or to yourself please visit [https://app.push.org/govern](https://app.push.org/govern)

**PUSH Holders:** $PUSH holders can delegate their voting power to anyone, including themselves. They can also delegate it to a PUSH Delegatee to ensure their views and thoughts are well represented. The PUSH Delegatee can be changed at any time\*\*.

As Push DAO evolves and gradually delegates ownership of programs and organizational units to the Push community, we will actively explore additional governance structures.

Presently, Push DAO is in the process of formalizing the operational framework for the Globalization subDAO and the Grants subDAO.
This empowers these subDAOs to function autonomously in conjunction with Push at the outset, with a long-term vision of transitioning to full community-led management.

Alright! Now that we have a good idea of what PUSH Governance is and the roles involved in it, let's dive in to understand the complete Governance procedure and how one can participate.
