# Introduction to Push Governance

A brief of overview of the Progressive Decentralized Governance of PUSH.

The first step toward the Progressive Decentralized Governance was taken on 16th September 2021 with the successful launch of PUSH Governance Phase ZERO.

The initial phases of PUSH Governance allowed our community to vote and participate in three ways:

**Grants Program:** allocating grants to teams, projects, and initiatives across the ecosystem that are helping build around the PUSH ecosystem. The grant funds will come from the $PUSH Community Allocation.

**Weekly Rockstar NFTs:** currently running the second season - each week (starting April 19th, 2021), community members who continue to help us on our mission to bring Push Protocol to the Web3 are airdropped an NFT along with a bag of $PUSH tokens. Recipients of this NFT are also eligible to join the Rockstars of PUSH protocol Token Gated Channel on our Discord and get access to exclusive content before everyone else. Voting for the recipient is part of the governance process.\*\*

**Meta-Governance:** token holders can pass and vote on measures affecting how the PUSH governance evolves past phase 0.

It must be noted that the current governance participation mechanisms are the initial stages of PUSH governance. However, as the protocol matures, PUSH Governance will further decentralize and include more categories giving the community more power over the protocol.

## Push Governance V2

As of June 1st 2024, Push DAO will have formally moved into governance phase two, which includes leadership by a council of five with two primary subDAOs for all interested individuals to onboard into.
These subDAOs are focused on: Business Development and Grants and those interested in reading the actual proposals that are now formalized structures, [can do so on the forum](https://gov.push.org/t/welcome-to-the-push-dao-forum/1628).

Our key goal with Push Governance V2 is to make it even easier to participate in Push DAO and the Push ecosystem as a whole. This includes ambassadors, who as of June 1st, will have a deeper role in the ecosystem through the DAO, including exciting ways to grow into greater roles.

## Governance Roles

There are still 3 crucial roles in Push governance. Now, with V2, however, these are:

**PUSH DAO Council Member**: [The Push DAO Council](https://gov.push.org/t/push-dao-v2-push-dao-council/1631) is a formalized set of delegates representing the interests of all sides of the Push ecosystem. As of May 5th, 2024, they were voted in by the community. DAO contributors who do not have time to vote or who contact or work with a council member and want to delegate their voting power to them, can do so. Alternatively, as noted below, they can delegate to anyone who holds PUSH. The Council is entrusted with voting power equal to the DAOâ€™s current budget as of May 6th 2024, at 1.4 million PUSH. At the end of August, a six seat will open up to a further member of the community.

**PUSH DAO Contributor**: A Push DAO Contributor is any PUSH holder. $PUSH holders can delegate their voting power to anyone, including themselves. They can also delegate it to a PUSH Council member or any other holder with a large amount of PUSH who they deem worthy of delegation, to ensure their views and thoughts are well represented. The PUSH Delegatee can be changed at any time.

**PUSH Ambassador**: Through being onboarded as an ambassador, you now formally have a place in Push DAO. Before our full launch, we will be sending an update to all ambassador hubs on the new paths to growth in the ecosystem through the DAO including how ambassadors can increase their earnings through helping with ongoing initiatives in the two subDAOs.

<hr />

As Push DAO evolves and gradually delegates ownership of programs and organizational units to the Push community, we will continue to evolve Push DAO, together.

Stay tuned for our Push DAO Constitution, which we plan to be live at the end of the month of May, after it is voted on by the entire community.

Alright! Now that we have a good idea of what PUSH Governance is and the roles involved in it, let's dive deeper into the complete system of Push Governance.
