# Governance

$PUSH token holders can participate in Push DAO governance . The amount of $PUSH tokens translates in your voting power that you can use to vote on proposals off-chain through Snapshot.

If you do not wish to participate into the governance directly, you can delegate your tokens at [https://app.push.org/govern](https://app.push.org/govern)
