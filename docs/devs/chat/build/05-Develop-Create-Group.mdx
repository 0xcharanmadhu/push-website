# About group chat
Group chat is the latest exciting addition to Push Chat, for the first time ever, web3 users are finally able to talk to each other in web3 native groups and have fine-grained controls over them allowing new ways by which community can be engaged besides adding new utilities to your token. Group chat enables protocols or web3 projects to create â€”

- DAO / NFT community
- Private or public groups
- Conditional / Gated group for joining or sending message
- Gating based on tokens, NFTs, social following or custom endpoint
- Ability to integrate in your UI (web / mobile) without users going to Discord, Telegram or breaking the UX

### Create group interface

```typescript
interface GroupRules {
  entry?: { conditions?: any[] };
  chat?: { conditions?: any[] };
}

interface GroupOptions {
  description?: string;
  image?: string; // base 64 encoded string
  members?: string[];
  admins?: string[];
  private?: boolean;
  rules?: GroupRules;
}

interface CreateGroupParams {
  name: string;
  options?: GroupOptions;
}

const createdGroup = async ({ name, options }: CreateGroupParams): Promise<any> => {
  // Your implementation here
};

// Example
const groupName = "Example Group";
const groupDescription = "This is an example group.";
const groupImage = "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0K..."; // example base64 encoded image string
const walletAddress1 = "0x123...";
const walletAddress2 = "0x456...";
const walletAddress3 = "0x789...";

const newGroup = await userAlice.chat.group.create(groupName, 
  {
    description: groupDescription,
    image: groupImage,
    members: [walletAddress1, walletAddress2, walletAddress3],
    admins: [],
    private: false,
    rules: {
      entry: { conditions: [] },
      chat: { conditions: [] },
    },
  },
});

```

### Token gated group example

```typescript
  // We are going to create a group that is:
  // Private - All conversations in this group is encrypted and visible only to members of the group
  // Gated entry by either of two rules 
  // Gated entry - Rule 1 - It takes 10 $XYZ token on Ethereum or on Polygon to join the group
  // Gated chat by rule of having $1000 XYZ on Ethereum token to allow sending chat in the group
  const myTokenGatedGroup = await userAlice.chat.group.create('BRB Chat', {
    description: 'This is your DAO community native web3 chat', // provide short description of group
    image: 'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0K...', // provide base64 encoded image
    members: ['0x123...', '0xABC...', 'eip155:0x754...'], // see types of recipient to learn more
    admins: ['nft:eip155:5:0x42af3147f17239341477113484752D5D3dda997B:2:1683058528'], // NFT addresses are supported as well
    private: true, // ensures chat within group is encrypted and is only visible to members of the group
    rules: { // define rules to gate different permissions of the group, ie: joining group or sending messages
      entry: { // define condition for joining the group
        conditions: [ // set of all conditions that should be fulfilled to join the group
          any: [ // define rule 1, set condition to 'any', if 'and' then all rules need to be fulfilled
            {
              type: "PUSH", // define type that rules engine should go for, currently supports PUSH or GUILD

                "comparison": ">=", // what comparision needs to pass
                "amount": 10 // amount that needs to passed
              }
            },
            {

                "comparison": ">=", // what comparision needs to pass
                "amount": 10 // amount that needs to passed
              }
            }
          ]
        ]
      },
      chat: {
        conditions: [
          any: [ // define rule 1, set condition to 'any', if 'and' then all rules need to be fulfilled
            {

            }
