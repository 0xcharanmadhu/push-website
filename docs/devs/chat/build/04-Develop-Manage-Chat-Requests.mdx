# Manage chat requests
You can send a message using [chat.send API](./send-message) to either an existing chat connection or to initiate a new chat to a wallet you haven't chatted with before (which is called sending a chat request).

Any chat from a push profile user who is not your connection already to your wallet lands in your **chat requests** and you will need to **accept**, **reject** or **block** them accordingly. This enables a seamless UX and **eliminates spam** problems with chat.
