# Sending Message
Push Chat doesn't require a user to be on the network for you to send message ðŸ˜€. Instead, it gives the you the freedom to send a nudge to an account or a message (or a meme). 

Though, it does come with a trade off of chats not being encrypted if a non-onboarded user of Push is sent a message though everything becomes completely E2EE from the moment the particular user is onboarded into the network.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import { ModalContainer, ModalSmall, ModalWrapper, AFocus } from '@site/src/components/SharedStylingV2';

<Tabs className="codetabs" groupId="code-examples">
  <TabItem value="js" attributes={{className: "codetab js"}} default>
    

  ```js
    // To Initialize Push User, pass the wallet signer
    const userAlice = await PushAPI.initialize(signer); 
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This instanciates and returns a **Push User Profile** object which is used to interact with all function calls moving forward.

## Beyond wallet addresses of EVM
Since Push Chat supports EVM wallets, NFT wallets and in the future will also support non-EVM wallets. It was important to come up with a compatible standard that is blockchain agnostic to ensure you can do cross-chain messaging or cross-nft messaging. This lead us to introduce support other wallet address formats as well  â€”

- **Standard Wallet Address** - Standard wallet `0x99A08ac6254dcf7ccc37CeC662aeba8eFA666666` supported
- **Blockchain Agnostic Wallet Address** - {blockchain standard}:{account id} format `eip155:0x99A08ac6254dcf7ccc37CeC662aeba8eFA666666` supported
- **NFT Wallet Address** - nft:{blockchain standard}{chain id}:{contract address}:{token id} format `nft:eip155:0x99A08ac6254dcf7ccc37CeC662aeba8eFA666666` supported
`nft:eip155:${nftChainId}:${nftContractAddress}:${nftTokenId}`
:::info
Blockchain Agnostic Wallet Address has been inspired by CAIP-10 format, which is a great step in marking wallet address blockchain agnostic. https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/main/CAIPs/caip-10.md
