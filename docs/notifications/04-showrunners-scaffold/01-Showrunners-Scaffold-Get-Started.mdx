# Showrunners scaffold overview

The showrunners framework is a scaffold that developers can use to build out notifications for their use cases.

Showrunners framework provides the tools and helpers required for constructing the payload and sending the notification using the Push protocol infrastructure.

Out-of-the-box showrunners provide the developer with a scheduling engine and libraries and helpers for easy access to blockchain data as well as web2 data sources.

## Setup showrunner

### Pre-requisites

You should have the following installed on your system:

- Docker
- Node JS
- NPM

### Clone showrunners scaffold repo

The initial step in setting up the showrunners is cloning the showrunners repo

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/push-protocol/push-website/push-showrunners-framework
```

This repository will contain the showrunner framework that you require to instantly build your channels logic.

Now in order to run this showrunner, we will need .env file which will contain your credentials that are required for fetching data from blockchains (for example, Infura).

For creating this `.env` file, simply copy the `.env.sample` file present in the root of the folder and replace the fields with valid credentials for each field.

```js
# MAKE A COPY OF THIS AND FILL WITH YOUR CREDENTIALS AND NAME IT .env (Remove .sample Part)

# SHOWRUNNERS ENVIRONMENT: prod or staging or dev
SHOWRUNNERS_ENV=staging

## NORMAL CONFIG
# DEBUG | CAN BE 'debug' or 'prod'
LOG_LEVEL=debug_or_prod # 'debug' or 'prod'

# WEB3 ENDPOINTS | NEED ATLEAST INFURA OR ETHERSCAN OR ALCHEMY, REST CAN BE NULL
INFURA_PROJECT_ID=your_infura_project_id
INFURA_PROJECT_SECRET=your_infura_project_secret

## ADVANCED CONFIG
# WEB3 ENDPOINTS | OPTIONAL IF YOU FILLED INFURA_PROJECT AND INFURA_PROJECT_SECRET, CAN SET IT TO NULL IF YOU WANT TO
ETHERSCAN_API=your_etherscan_api_key_or_null
ALCHEMY_API=your_alchemy_api_key_or_null
```

| Param                   | Valid Values                           | Comment                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `SHOWRUNNERS_ENV`       | `prod` or `staging`                    | Describes the Push Network you are targeting. If you deployed your channel on staging then this will be `staging` else if you deployed on mainnet (even multi-chain channel) then this will be `prod`. |
| `LOG_LEVEL`             | `debug` or `prod`                      | Changes the amount of log generated, recommended to use debug until you are sure of the logic.                                                                                                         |
| `INFURA_PROJECT`        | `your_infura_project_id` or `null`     | Head to [infura.io](https://infura.io) to generate one, required to query data of blockchain.                                                                                                          |
| `INFURA_PROJECT_SECRET` | `your_infura_project_secret` or `null` | Need at least one (Infura, Etherscan or Alchemy) to operate correctly.                                                                                                                                 |
| `ETHERSCAN_API`         | `your_etherscan_api_key` or `null`     | Head to [etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io) to generate one, required to query data of blockchain.                                                                                                    |
| `ALCHEMY_API`           | `your_alchemy_api_key` or `null`       | Head to [alchemy.com](https://alchemy.com) to generate one, required to query data of blockchain.                                                                                                      |

:::caution
At least INFURA_PROJECT, INFURA_PROJECT_SECRET or ETHERSCAN_API or ALCHEMY_API key is required to correctly operate showrunners. Recommended to put all as the data fetching becomes more decentralised.

### Install dependancies

Now that you have set up the showrunners `.env` file, you are all set to run the showrunners. Ensure that all dependencies are installed, open the terminal (or command prompt), and go to the root of the cloned repo, `npm install` or `yarn install` to install dependencies.

<Tabs className="showrunners" groupId="showrunners-install">
  <TabItem value="npm" default>

```zsh
npm install
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="yarn">

```zsh
yarn install
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Run docker

Next, open another terminal and type `docker-compose up` to start running docker image.

```zsh
docker-compose up
```

### Start showrunners

Finally, open another terminal and ensure you are still at the root of the cloned repo and type `npm start` or `yarn start`.

<Tabs className="showrunners" groupId="showrunners-install">
  <TabItem value="npm" default>

```zsh
npm start
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="yarn">

```zsh
yarn start
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

If everything is good, this is the output that you should see! Congrats, you just installed Showrunners framework ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š running on the port: `5432` ðŸ’ª.

:::info
You might see that showrunners are throwing an error explaining that no channels can be found, a channel is what is needed to run logic controls through showrunners.

Let's dive in and see next how to create your hello world channel to run on top of the showrunners framework!
:::

## Setup trigger channel - Hello World

Let's create a simple trigger channel next to see how notifications can be triggered automatically from Showrunners framework. For this example, we will use a pre-existing template present inside Showrunners scaffold called Hello World.

Hello World channel exists to simply demonstrate how easy it is to send notifications in Web3. To setup the channel, you will need to do the following things.

### Setup

- Ensure that you have [created your channel](/docs/notifications/tutorials/create-your-channel/ "Tutorial on how to create your channel") and make a note of the private key used for the same.

- Head to `src/sample_showrunners` from the git clone of `push-showrunners-framework` which you just setup.

- Copy the folder `helloWorld` and drop it in `src/showrunners` folder.

  You might notice that the showrunners has already moved to complain about `helloWorldKeys.json` not containing the correct private key.

  ```js
  {
    "PRIVATE_KEY_NEW_STANDARD_1":
    {
        "PK": "YOUR_CHANNEL_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE",
        "CHAIN_ID": "CHAIN_ID_HERE"
    },
  }
  ```

  - Just copy and paste the private key of your channel instead of `YOUR_CHANNEL_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE`
  - For `CHAIN_ID_HERE`, You will need to paste the multi chain id format, some examples of supported formats are:

  | Network name       | Chain_ID | Required ENV setting      | Remarks                                                                       |
  | ------------------ | -------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `Ethereum Mainnet` | 1        | `SHOWRUNNERS_ENV=prod`    | Note: Use `eip155:1` if you deployed your channel on Ethereum Mainnet.        |
  | `Polygon Mainnet`  | 137      | `SHOWRUNNERS_ENV=prod`    | Note: Use `eip155:137` if you deployed your channel on Polygon Mainnet.       |
  | `BNB Mainnet`      | 56       | `SHOWRUNNERS_ENV=prod`    | Note: Use `eip155:111551116` if you deployed your channel on BNB Mainnet.     |
  | `Arbitrum Mainnet` | 42151    | `SHOWRUNNERS_ENV=prod`    | Note: Use `eip155:42151` if you deployed your channel on Arbitrum Mainnet.    |
  | `Ethereum Testnet` | 11155111 | `SHOWRUNNERS_ENV=staging` | Note: Use `eip155:11155111` if you deployed your channel on Ethereum Testnet. |
  | `Polygon Mumbai`   | 80001    | `SHOWRUNNERS_ENV=staging` | Note: Use `eip155:80001` if you deployed your channel on Polygon Mumbai.      |
  | `BNB Testnet`      | 97       | `SHOWRUNNERS_ENV=staging` | Note: Use `eip155:97` if you deployed your channel on BNB Testnet.            |
  | `Arbitrum Goerli`  | 421613   | `SHOWRUNNERS_ENV=staging` | Note: Use `eip155:421613` if you deployed your channel on Arbitrum Goerli.    |

Now run `npm start` or `yarn start` again and you should be able to see the following screen:

Congrats, your channel custom notification trigger is setup and good to go. Let's look at what components of your channel folders enable what functionality next!
