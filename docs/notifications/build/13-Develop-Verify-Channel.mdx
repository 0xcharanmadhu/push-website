## What are verified channels?

EPNS Core contract also includes a new Channel Verification feature which allows Channels to have a verification tag.

The verification tag of a Channel has its own significance. While on one hand, a verified channel enhances the userâ€™s reliability on the channel and its notifications, it also gets a comparatively better position on the User interface.

## Understanding the Channel Verification procedure

Channels in the EPNS Core protocol can have either a Primary or a Secondary verification tag.

a. Primary Verification tag: Channels that have directly been verified by the Push Channel Admin are the ones that have a primary verification tag.
All Primary Verified channels have the power to verify other unverified channels.

b. Secondary Verification tag: Channels that have been verified by other Primary Verified channels and not directly by the Push Channel Admin, have a secondary verification tag.

## Verify Channel API

:::note
The wallet must have a channel with verification tag to verify other channels.

  <TabItem value="js" attributes={{className: "codetab js"}} default>

```typescript
