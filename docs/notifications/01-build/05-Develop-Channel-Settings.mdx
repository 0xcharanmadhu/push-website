# Channel settings overview

This section covers APIs related to creation of channel setting.

<head>
  <title>Channel Settings | Push Notifications | Push Documentation</title>
</head>

## What are channel settings?

A channel may want to send notification for multiple categories. Ex: Coindesk may want to send notifications for tech, marketing, defi and so on. Similarly, Aave may want to send notifciation for certain loan liquidation value. 

Having settings for your channel enables your users to express interest on what settings they want to receive notifications for and when they want to receive it. 

Once you have enabled channel settings, you can access settings prefrence of each user via [Fetch Subscription API](/docs/notifications/build/fetch-subscriptions/ "Fetch subscription API for channel settings"). You can also trigger notifications which target particular settings category via [Send Notification API](/docs/notifications/build/send-notification/ "Send notification API for sending notification meant for vertain category").

:::note
If a user hasn't opted in for a particular setting and you trigger notification for that setting category then the notification will be filtered out by Push Node.
