# What is a Notification in Push protocol?

Notifications follow composable blocks that helps achieve modular structure and helps in building on top of them. Any developer can utilize the notification protocol to send out notifications (on-chain or off-chain) to their users from a variety of platforms including web3 protocols, smart contracts, dapps, backend, etc. 

These notifications are tied to wallet address of the user and are indexed by push nodes allowing any crypto frontend such as wallet, dapp or mobile app to query and display these notifications for the wallet users along with sending them out as push notifications.

![Notification Composable Block](/assets/docs/notifications/notification-standards/notification-standards-advanced/notificationComposableBlock.png "Representation of composable blocks of notification")

## Composability Structure
Each notification is made up of these composable blocks:

```
Verification - To verify the notification
    Identity - To understand the storage format and rules to interpret the notification payload
        Payload - To understand what is the type of notification, what data it contains and to whom it should be addresses to
            Content - To interpret or extend format types for content inside the notification
```

- `Verification` - It defines the way to verify that the payload is valid by checking sender, source, and authenticitiy of the payload content.
- `Identity` - Notification Identity Payload is the standard through which notification payload can be sent to Push Nodes for processing. There are multiple ways by which these payloads can be stored (storage-independent behavior) and identity ensures that the push node are able to understand and construct the notification payload from the data.
- `Payload` - Each notification sent to the protocol is essentially a JSON payload which contains data about things a notification contains, notification recipients and even data to encrypt these notifications. This json payload is what makes Push Protocol payload content-independent and allows for expansion to several new types of notifications based on the community needs and as the communication protocol develops further.
- `Content` - Notification Content Markdown standardize the content markdown and create a standard for styling and formatting.


## Notification Verification Proof
Verification Proof is the outermost composable block that is sent along with the notification to help the network validate the notification sender, the chain from which the notification is sent, and the content of the notification along with any other validation that might be required.

Verification proofs differ based on the platform from which they are sent. For instance, **smart contracts verification proof can be validated on-chain** and smart contract-based notifications will usually carry transaction hash proofs, while **off-chain / gasless notifications usually carry eip712 proofs**, though they are capable of carrying smart contract verification proof as well which makes it composable.

### Understanding Verification Proof

1. `eip155:chainId:txHash::uid::optionaluid` - This signifies the on-chain verification. Currently, Ethereum and Polygon are supported networks and it can be verified by resolving the transaction hash from the respective chains and making sure that identity is present in the block. 

2. `eip712v1` - This signifies the verification from the off-chain, the verification is done through an EIP-712-based signature. 

  :::caution
  eip-712v1 has a limitation to support only completed old payloads which include all the parameters of the payload which are part of notification, data, and recipients. 

  As identity formats like 0, 1 and 3 have single string payload, only identity 2 is compatible with eip-712v1. To overcome this limitation eip-712v2 is introduced which is identity-independent.
  :::

3. `eip712v2` - eip712v2:&lt;Proof&gt;, it contains a payload that is future compatible. It means the payload can be dynamic and can be extended for future reference.

4. `thegraph` - Notification can be triggered through a subgraph as well
  They need to call the addSubgraph function from Push Core Contract to add the subgraph. The Push Node will pick up the same and verification proof for this consists of:
    - **`GraphId`**: This will be the id of subgraph. It is usually represented as `githubid/subgraph` name e.g - `push/pushsubgraph`.
    - **`notification number[counter]`** - It will keep the count of Notifications and will process in a successive manner.
    - **`::uid::optionaluid`** - **::uid** is an optional delimiter which if present along with **optionaluid** allows the proof to be uniquely different.

## Notification Identity
Identity defines where the notification is coming from and the rules by which we can get the payload JSON of that specific notification. Currently, supported identities are Minimal, IPFS, Direct, and Subgraph.

### Specifications
Each notification identity carries at least two parameters which are joined by +  delimiter.

- **`Storage Type`**: The first parameter represents **the identity type used** (Minimal, IPFS, Direct, etc). The type id represents where the payload is stored or coming from.
- **`Payload storage info`**: Hash of the payload representing proof or pointer from which the payload can be retrieved. The second parameter represents either the **hash or identifying information** that can be used to fetch the necessary JSON which can also be made of composable information.

**Storage Types**
As of now, there are 4 types of storage that are supported:

| Id  | Type                   | Defintion                                          |
| --- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 0   | Minimal                | Recommended for Smart Contract                     |
| 1   | IPFS                   | Indicates storage on IPFS                          |
| 2   | Direct Payload         | Indicates storage of direct payload                |
| 3   | SubGraph               | Indicates storage on the subgraph                  |

### Identity Examples
<details>
<summary>Identity Type 0</summary>

**Format:** `0+<Notification Payload Type>+<Title>+<Body>`

`<Notification Payload Type>`: Type of notification (Broadcast, Subset, Targetted, Secret, etc)

`<Title>`: This will be the title of the Message. 

`<Body>`: This will be the body/description of the Message.

**Example:**
```
0+1+Hello+This is a broadacasted notification
```
