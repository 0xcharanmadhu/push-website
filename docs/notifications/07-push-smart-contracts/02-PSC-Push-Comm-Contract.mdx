# Push Comm Contract

Unlike the Push core smart contract, the communicator protocol is designed to be deployed on multiple chains. This is also one of the imperative reasons behind the communicator contract being lightweight and less reliant on Push Core.

The Push Communicator protocol is comparatively quite simple. The communicator protocol includes features that allow users to subscribe to a channel, unsubscribe from a channel as well as the imperative one, i.e., sending notifications.

As the communicator protocol can be deployed on various chains, it allows us to trigger notifications on multiple chains and not just the Ethereum blockchain.

:::important
Push Communicator smart contracts are necessary to be deployed on any chain where notification directly from smart contracts feature is enabled.

## Types & Modifiers

Explains the different types of Data types and access controls used in the Push comm smart contract

### Storage Variables

```solidity
  address public governance;
  address public pushChannelAdmin;
  uint256 public chainID;
  uint256 public usersCount;
  bool public isMigrationComplete;
  address public EPNSCoreAddress;
  string public chainName;
  string public constant name = "EPNS COMM V1";
```

## Structs

```solidity
struct User {
  bool userActivated;
  bool publicKeyRegistered;

  uint256 userStartBlock;

  uint256 subscribedCount;
  mapping(address => uint8) isSubscribed;
  mapping(address => uint256) subscribed;
  mapping(uint256 => address) mapAddressSubscribed;
}
```

The **User** struct in the Push Communicator smart contract stores all the crucial data of a particular user on the smart contract â€”

### userActivated

- Depicts whether or not a user is ACTIVE

### publicKeyRegistered

- Returns TRUE if the user's PUBLIC KEY has been registered in the communicator

### userStartBlock

- Represents the block number when the user was added to the protocol

### subscribedCount

- Keeps trakc of the total number of channels a user is subscribed to\*\*

### isSubscribed

- Keeps track of whether or not a user is subscribed to a specific channel address.

### subscribed

- Maps channel address to ID

### mapAddressSubscribed

- Maps ID to Channel Address

## Modifiers

### onlyPushChannelAdmin()

- Only allows Push Channel Admin to access the function

### onlyEPNSCore()

- Only allows EPNS Core Contract to access a particular function
- Specifically used in the **subscribeViaCore()** fucntion

### sendNotifViaSignReq()

- Ensures that all the necessary checkpoints before sending notification from EPNS Communicator is passed.
- Used in the **sendNotifBySig()** function.

## Mappings

### users

- `mapping(address => User) public users;`
- Maps a user's address to the User struct

### nonces

- `mapping(address => uint256) public nonces;`
- Keeps track of the nonce of a specific address
- Specifically used in the Meta transaction functions

### mapAddressUsers

- `mapping(uint256 => address) public mapAddressUsers;`
- Maps ID to User's address
- Updated in the \_addUser() function of the protocol

### userToChannelNotifs

- `mapping(address => mapping(address => string)) public userToChannelNotifs;`
- Keeps track the user's Notification settings for a specific channel

### delegatedNotificationSenders

- `mapping(address => mapping(address => bool)) public delegatedNotificationSenders;`
- Keeps track of valid delegate notification sender for a particular channel

_`Meta Transaction Functions`_

The EPNS Communicator protocol supports meta transactions or, in other words, gasless transactions. These allow users to interact with functions without incurring gas fees.

Instead of incurring the gas costs themselves, they sign a transaction and then an operator submits it on their behalf. The protocol then verifies the signature and executes the required function.

        bytes32 r,
        bytes32 s
