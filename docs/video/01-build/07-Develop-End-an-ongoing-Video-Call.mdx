## Ending an Ongoing Video Call

When the user decides to end an ongoing video call, we call the `disconnect()` method.

```typescript
// aliceVideoCall.disconnect(address);
await aliceVideoCall.disconnect(address);
```

| Property    | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _`address`_ | `string` | Wallet address of the peer. This can be read from `data` state which we setup during Push Video API Initializing step, `data.incoming[0].address` will hold the address of the connected peer. |

:::info
When the user ends the video call by calling `disconnect()` method, the stream will emit `DisconnectVideo` event on the other end. Please refer to the [Stream API](../stream-video) section for more details.
