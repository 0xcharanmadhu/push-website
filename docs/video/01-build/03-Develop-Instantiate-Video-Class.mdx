# Instantiating Video Class Overview

Push Video API abstract away connection and encryption methods by exposing methods which lets you create video object that is used for video calls.

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

</head>

import { ABlock } from "@site/src/css/SharedStyling";

## Prerequisites

Some functions require passing the signer object with the function call. Fetching a signer for web3 wallets is quite easy.

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="frontend" label="When using Frontend" default>
```

```typescript
// any other web3 ui lib is also acceptable
import { useWeb3React } from "@web3-react/core";
.
.
.
const { account, library, chainId } = useWeb3React();
const signer = library.getSigner(account);
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="backend" label="When using Backend">
```

```typescript
const ethers = require("ethers");
const PK = "your_channel_address_secret_key";
const Pkey = `0x${PK}`;
const signer = new ethers.Wallet(Pkey);
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

## Instantiate Video Class

To start video calling wallet addresses, first, you need to declare `data`, `setData` which are essentially a state/variable to hold video call-related data and a function to modify it respectively and we need to create a local media stream.&#x20;

Here below is how to instantiate Video Class:

```typescript
  // Instantiate video object and creating media stream
  const aliceVideoCall = await userAlice.video.initialize(
    setData: (fn: (data: VideoCallData) => VideoCallData) => void, // Function to update the video call data, takes a function as an argument which receives the latest state of data as a param and should return the modified/new state of data,
    {
      media: {
        video: boolean, // to enable video on start
        audio: boolean, // to enable audio on start
      }
      stream?: MediaStream; // to initialize with existing media stream (for backend use)
    }
  );
```

| Property | Description                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| setData  | Function to update the video call data, takes a function as an argument which receives the latest state of data as a param and should return the modified/new state of data |
| video    | Whether the video should be enabled or not during the call. Defaults to `true`.                                                                                             |
| audio    | Whether the audio should be enabled or not during the call. Defaults to `true`.                                                                                             |
| stream   | Local stream. For backend use. Defaults to `null`.                                                                                                                          |

Now let's go over each property individually and understand how to set them.

### Understanding data variable

- The `data` variable is an object that is used to store all of the video call-related data.
- It is of type `PushAPI.VideoCallData` and should be initialized with `initVideoCallData`.
- For React-based projects, this would basically be a React state, and for vanilla JS projects, it will be a simple JS variable.

The type `PushAPI.VideoCallData` is described below:

```typescript
// IMediaStream is a custom type that represents a media stream object or null
type IMediaStream = MediaStream | null;

// VideoCallStatus is an enum that represents different statuses of a video call
// These values are used to indicate the current status of a video call
enum VideoCallStatus {
  // call hasn't been started yet
  UNINITIALIZED,

  // call has been started by the initiator but not received by the receiver
  INITIALIZED,

  // call has been received by the receiver but not connected yet
  RECEIVED,

  // call has been connected, and both users can interact now
  // MediaStream (includes both audio and video) exchange is now possible
  CONNECTED,

  // when the call request is denied by the peer (receiver)
  DISCONNECTED,

  // call has been ended by one of the users
  ENDED

  // retrying to establish the call from the INITIALIZED state
  RETRY_INITIALIZED,

  // retrying to establish the call from the RECEIVED state
  RETRY_RECEIVED,
}

type VideoCallData = {
  meta: {
    // contains meta info of the video call
    chatId: string; // unique identifier for every push chat
    initiator: {
      address: string; // address of the initiator of the call
      signal: any; // signal data from the initiator
    };
    broadcast?: {
      // will be used in Push Spaces
      livepeerInfo: any;
      hostAddress: string;
      coHostAddress: string;
    };
  };
  // This property is used to store the info of the local peer/user
  local: {
    stream: IMediaStream; // the stream object
    audio: boolean | null; // whether local audio is on or not
    video: boolean | null; // whether local video is on or not
    address: string; // address of the local peer/user
  };
  incoming: [
    // This property is used to store the info of an incoming peer/user
    {
      stream: IMediaStream; // the stream object
      audio: boolean | null; // whether incoming audio is on or not
      video: boolean | null; // whether incoming video is on or not
      address: string; // address of the incoming peer/user
      status: VideoCallStatus; // video call status with a particular incoming peer
      retryCount: number; // no. of retries required in establishing the call
    },
  ];
};
```

The `initVideoCallData` looks like the following:

```typescript
// As mentioned earlier, this should be used to initialize the data variable.
const initVideoCallData: PushAPI.VideoCallData = {
  meta: {
    chatId: "",
    initiator: {
      address: "",
      signal: null,
    },
  },
  local: {
    stream: null,
    audio: null,
    video: null,
    address: "",
  },
  incoming: [
    {
      stream: null,
      audio: null,
      video: null,
      address: "",
      status: VideoCallStatus.UNINITIALIZED, // call is at the UNINITIALIZED status
      retryCount: 0,
    },
  ],
};
```

Creating and initializing the `data` variable is shown below:

```typescript
// NOTE: You don't have to define initVideoCallData in your project.
// Just import it using the following and use it:
import { initVideoCallData } from "@pushprotocol/restapi/src/lib/video";

// 1. For a vanilla JS project
let data: PushAPI.VideoCallData = initVideoCallData;

// 2. For a React project
import { useState } from "react";
const [data, setData] = useState<PushAPI.VideoCallData>(initVideoCallData);
```

### setData function

- `setData` is a function to update the video call data i.e., the `data` variable.
- It is of type `(fn: (data: VideoCallData) => VideoCallData) => void` and is described below:

```typescript
/*
- fn function is supplied by the caller of setData()
- fn is a function that accepts current 'data' as input and returns updated 'data'
*/
const setData: : (fn: (data: VideoCallData) => VideoCallData) => void = (fn) => {
  /*
    - Here, we are passing the current value of 'data' to fn
    - The return value of fn() i.e., the updated value of 'data' is assigned back to 'data'
  */
data = fn(data);
};
```

### Media Stream

```typescript
  // Instantiate video object and creating media stream
  const aliceVideoCall = await userAlice.video.initialize(setData, {
      media: {
        video: Boolean, // to enable video on start
        audio: Boolean, // to enable audio on start
      }
      stream?: MediaStream; // to initialize with existing media stream (for backend use)
  });
```

- initialise() function generates a new MediaStream object using `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia`
- The `video` and `audio` boolean params are used to tell if you want to enable your audio/video during the video call or not. Example:
  - If you pass the `video` as `false`, your video will be disabled during the entire call. If you pass it as `true`, then your video will be turned on initially during the call, and later, you will have the option to toggle it on or off.
  - For `audio` the above logic is the same.

:::info
If `stream` object is passed as a param to `initialise()` function then `initialise` doesn't generate a new MediaStream rather, it would just assigns `data.local.stream` to the passed `stream` object param. This is for backend use.
:::

:::info
âš  **Warning**: If `audio`, `video` aren't passed as true in `initialise()` then they won't be available during the entire video call respectively.
