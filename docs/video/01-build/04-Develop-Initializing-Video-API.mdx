# Initialising Video API Overview

Push Video API abstract away connection and encryption methods by exposing methods which lets you make and handle video calls.

## Prerequisites

Before being able to Initialize Video API,

- You need to initialize `User`. If you haven't done that yet, please refer to [Initializing User](../initialize-user) to learn how to do that.
- You need to initialize Push `Stream`. If you haven't done that yet, please refer to [Initializing Stream API](../stream-video) to learn how to do that.

## Initializing Video API

To start video calling wallet addresses, first, you need to declare `data`, `setData` which are essentially a state/variable to hold video call-related data and a function to modify it respectively and we need to create a local media stream.&#x20;

Here below is how to initializing Video API:

```typescript
  // Initialising the video API
  // in react, you can use useState hook to declare data and setData like this: const [data, setData] = useState<VideoCallData>(initVideoCallData);
  // in vanilla js, you can declare data and setData like this: let data = initVideoCallData; const setData = (fn: (data: VideoCallData) => VideoCallData) => {data = fn(data)}

  // async initialize(onChange: (fn: (data: VideoCallData) => VideoCallData) => void, options: VideoInitializeOptions): Promise<VideoV2>;
  const aliceVideoCall = await userAlice.video.initialize(setData, {
    stream: Stream, // pass the stream object created using Stream API, please refer to [Initializing Stream API] to learn how to get this stream object.
    config: {
      video: true, // to enable video on start, for frontend use
      audio: true, // to enable audio on start, for frontend use
    },
    media?: MediaStream, // to pass your existing media stream(for backend use)
  });
```

Now let's go over each property individually and understand how to set them.

### Understanding data variable

- The `data` variable is an object that is used to store all of the video call-related data.
- It is of type `PushAPI.VideoCallData` and should be initialized with `initVideoCallData`.
- For React-based projects, this would basically be a React state, and for vanilla JS projects, it will be a simple JS variable.

The type `PushAPI.VideoCallData` is described below:

```typescript
// IMediaStream is a custom type that represents a media stream object or null
type IMediaStream = MediaStream | null;

// VideoCallStatus is an enum that represents different statuses of a video call
// These values are used to indicate the current status of a video call
enum VideoCallStatus {
  // call hasn't been started yet
  UNINITIALIZED,

  // call has been started by the initiator but not received by the receiver
  INITIALIZED,

  // call has been received by the receiver but not connected yet
  RECEIVED,

  // call has been connected, and both users can interact now
  // MediaStream (includes both audio and video) exchange is now possible
  CONNECTED,

  // when the call request is denied by the peer (receiver)
  DISCONNECTED,

  // call has been ended by one of the users
  ENDED

  // retrying to establish the call from the INITIALIZED state
  RETRY_INITIALIZED,

  // retrying to establish the call from the RECEIVED state
  RETRY_RECEIVED,
}

type VideoCallData = {
  meta: {
    // contains meta info of the video call
    chatId: string; // unique identifier for every push chat
    initiator: {
      address: string; // address of the initiator of the call
      signal: any; // signal data from the initiator
    };
    broadcast?: {
      // will be used in Push Spaces
      livepeerInfo: any;
      hostAddress: string;
      coHostAddress: string;
    };
  };
  // This property is used to store the info of the local peer/user
  local: {
    stream: IMediaStream; // the stream object
    audio: boolean | null; // whether local audio is on or not
    video: boolean | null; // whether local video is on or not
    address: string; // address of the local peer/user
  };
  incoming: [
    // This property is used to store the info of an incoming peer/user
    {
      stream: IMediaStream; // the stream object
      audio: boolean | null; // whether incoming audio is on or not
      video: boolean | null; // whether incoming video is on or not
      address: string; // address of the incoming peer/user
      status: VideoCallStatus; // video call status with a particular incoming peer
      retryCount: number; // no. of retries required in establishing the call
    },
  ];
};
```

The `initVideoCallData` looks like the following:

```typescript
// As mentioned earlier, this should be used to initialize the data variable.
const initVideoCallData: PushAPI.VideoCallData = {
  meta: {
    chatId: "",
    initiator: {
      address: "",
      signal: null,
    },
  },
  local: {
    stream: null,
    audio: null,
    video: null,
    address: "",
  },
  incoming: [
    {
      stream: null,
      audio: null,
      video: null,
      address: "",
      status: VideoCallStatus.UNINITIALIZED, // call is at the UNINITIALIZED status
      retryCount: 0,
    },
  ],
};
```

Creating and initializing the `data` variable is shown below:

```typescript
// NOTE: You don't have to define initVideoCallData in your project.
// Just import it using the following and use it:
import { initVideoCallData } from "@pushprotocol/restapi/src/lib/video";

// 1. For a vanilla JS project
let data: PushAPI.VideoCallData = initVideoCallData;

// 2. For a React project
import { useState } from "react";
const [data, setData] = useState<PushAPI.VideoCallData>(initVideoCallData);
```

### setData function

- `setData` is a function to update the video call data i.e., the `data` variable.
- It is of type `(fn: (data: VideoCallData) => VideoCallData) => void` and is described below:

```typescript
/*
- fn function is supplied by the caller of setData()
- fn is a function that accepts current 'data' as input and returns updated 'data'
*/
const setData: : (fn: (data: VideoCallData) => VideoCallData) => void = (fn) => {
  /*
    - Here, we are passing the current value of 'data' to fn
    - The return value of fn() i.e., the updated value of 'data' is assigned back to 'data'
  */
data = fn(data);
};
```

### Stream Object

```typescript
  // Initialising the video API
  const aliceVideoCall = await userAlice.video.initialize(setData, {
      stream: stream,
      ...
  });
```

- `stream` object is created using Push Stream API, which is basically to listen video call events and is used handle video call operations.
- Please refer to [Initializing Stream API](../stream-video) to learn how to get this stream object.

### Media Stream

```typescript
  // Initialising the video API
  const aliceVideoCall = await userAlice.video.initialize(setData, {
      ...
      config: {
        video: Boolean, // to enable video on start
        audio: Boolean, // to enable audio on start
      },
      media?: MediaStream; // to initialize with existing media stream (for backend use)
  });

```

- initialise() function generates a new MediaStream object using `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia` from the available browser APIs.
- The `video` and `audio` boolean params are used to tell if you want to enable your audio/video during the video call or not.

Example:

- If you pass the `video` as `false`, your video will be disabled during the entire call. If you pass it as `true`, then your video will be turned on initially during the call, and later, you will have the option to toggle it on or off.
- For `audio` the above logic is the same.

- media is used to pass your existing media stream. This is for backend use.

:::info
If `media` object is passed as a param to `initialise()` function then `initialise` doesn't generate a new MediaStream rather, it would just assigns `data.local.stream` to the passed `media` object param. This is for backend use.
:::

:::info
⚠ **Warning**: If `audio`, `video` aren't passed as true in `initialise()` then they won't be available during the entire video call respectively.
