# Accepting a video call

This section covers everything you need to know about handling an incoming call.

<head>
  <title>Handle Incoming Video Call | Push Video | Push Documentation</title>
</head>

## Prerequisites

- You have initialized Push Video API. Please refer to the [Initializing Video API](/docs/video/build/initializing-video-api/) section for more details.
- You are listening to Video Stream events, Please refer to the [Stream API](/docs/video/build/stream-video) section for more details.

## Handling Incoming Video Call

Earlier, we set up the Push Video Stream and event listeners in the [Stream API](/docs/video/build/stream-video) section. Now, when there is an incoming video call request, the `stream` emits a `RequestVideo` event. This event can be used to display a UI modal to the user, allowing them to accept or deny the incoming call.

```typescript
stream.on(CONSTANTS.STREAM.VIDEO, async (data: TYPES.VIDEO.EVENT) => {
  if (data.event === CONSTANTS.VIDEO.EVENT.REQUEST) {
    // RequestVideo Event is fired when there is an incoming video call request
    // store the incoming peer address which will be used to accept/reject the call
    // it is recommended to store the incoming caller address in a state that is received
    // let incomingCallerAddress = data.peerInfo.address;
  }
  // other events
});
```

## Accepting an Video Call

When a user receives an incoming video call request, it needs to be approved by the user before the call can be established. To approve an incoming video call request, we call the `approve()` method which optionally accepts the `address` of the incoming caller received from the stream event. If the `address` is not passed, the `approve()` method will approve the first incoming call.

```typescript
// aliceVideoCall.approve(address?);
await aliceVideoCall.approve();
```

### Parameters

| Property  | Type     | Description                                                                |
| --------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `address` | `string` | `address` of the caller received from the stream event in the Push Stream. |

> Note: Parameters _`in this style`_ are mandatory.

:::success
Once the user approves the call, the video call is then established. ðŸŽ‰
:::
:::info
When a user approves an incoming video call request, on the call intiator's end, the stream emits `ApproveVideo` event. We can use this event to show an UI Toast to the initiator that the call has been approved.
:::

## Rejecting an Video Call

When a user receives an incoming video call request, it can be denied/rejected by the user. To deny/reject an incoming video call request, we call the `deny()` method which optionally accepts the `address` of the incoming caller received from the stream event. If the `address` is not passed, the `deny()` method will deny the first incoming call.

```typescript
// aliceVideoCall.deny(address?);
await aliceVideoCall.deny();
```

### Parameters

| Property  | Type     | Description                                                                |
| --------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `address` | `string` | `address` of the caller received from the stream event in the Push Stream. |

> Note: Parameters _`in this style`_ are mandatory.

:::info
When a user denies/rejects an incoming video call request, on the call intiator's end, the stream emits `DenyVideo` event. We can use this event to intimate the initiator that the video call was rejected.
:::

## Understanding the peerInfo object

The `peerInfo` object received in the stream event basically contains the address of the caller and the signal data required to establish a video call. While you don't need to worry about the signal data, you can use the address of the caller to display the caller's name or profile picture in the UI.

```typescript
{
 "peerInfo":{
    "address":"0x...", // Address of the caller (initiator)
    "signal":"...", // Signal data required to establish a video call
    "meta":{
      "rules":{
        "access":{
          "type": "PUSH_CHAT",
          "data":{
            "chatId": "...", // ChatId between the caller and the callee
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
