## Prerequisites

- You are listening to Video Stream events, Please refer to the [Stream API](/docs/video/build/stream-video) section for more details.
- There is an ongoing video call between the user and a peer.

## Ending an Ongoing Video Call

When the user decides to end an ongoing video call, we call the `disconnect()` method.

```typescript
// aliceVideoCall.disconnect();
await aliceVideoCall.disconnect();
```

:::info
When the user ends the video call by calling `disconnect()` method, the stream will emit `DisconnectVideo` event on the other end. Please refer to the [Stream API](/docs/video/build/stream-video) section for more details.
