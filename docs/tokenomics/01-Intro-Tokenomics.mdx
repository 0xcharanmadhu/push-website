# Intro to Push Protocol

Push uses it's native token - [___`$PUSH`___](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/epns/ "$PUSH at Coinmarketcap.com") to enable utility, governance, security and to provide incentives for users, crypto wallets and other players in the Push Protocol. 

Push Protocol (previously Ethereum Push Notification Service, EPNS) is a decentralized protocol for web3 communication among users (wallet addresses). Push enables protocols to use all forms of communication, including [notifications](/docs/notifications/ "Intro to Push Notifications"), [chat](/docs/chat/ "Intro to Push Chat"), [video](/docs/video/ "Intro to Push Video") or [spaces](/docs/ "Intro to Push Spaces") for wallet addresses. 

It achieves this with a decentralized communication protocol that allows any app, service, or back-end to send on- or off-chain notifications (or any other communication) to a wallet address. 

Push Protocol solves the missing problem of web3 communication, and significantly improves the UX of the decentralized web and its applications and is the key to achieve Web2 level adoption (aka getting billion users for Web3).

## How does it work?
Each communication to wallet (whether notification, chat, video or spaces) are payloads with specific formats that are sent to **Push Network** are validated and indexed by **Push Nodes** in an open (but encrypted), gasless, multi-chain, and platform-independent manner. 

Since **Push Nodes** are part of an open network (similar to Ethereum network but for communication), any crypto wallet (such as [Metamask x Push snap](https://snaps.metamask.io/snap/npm/pushprotocol/snap/ "Push Metamask Snap"), [Push mobile app](https://app.push.org/receive "Link to push mobile app among others"), etc or any dApp can then interact with this network and show communications to their users (aka web3 wallet addresses).

## Why it's needed?
Web3 has been on “single player mode.” Meaning, interaction has largely been single-direction. Apps communicate through monolithic communication methods like email, Medium, Twitter, Discord, WeChat, and more. 

When communities do come together to talk to one another, they are forced to do so outside of the technology stack they are so passionate about.

For rapidly-evolving use cases like DeFi, these single-sided, web2 forms of communication struggle to scale. Expressive, “multi-player,” web3-native, peer-to-peer social experiences are needed to enable scale. 

Push Protocol brings notifications, chat, and communication into the web3 stack, unlocking composability and capabilities for developers, and giving users entirely new ways of interacting with web3.

## Traction by numbers
Push protocol (Previously EPNS) invented notifications for Web3 and started from [ETHGlobal 2020](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/epns-ethereum-push-notification-service-mtba0 "Push (EPNS) Genesis")! From then to now, it has rebranded, introduced other forms of communications (Chat, Video, Spaces) and have terraformed the communication landscape of Web3.

From then to now, Push has gone on to power —
