We are thrilled to announce the arrival of <b>EPNS Chrome Browser Extension Alpha v0.1!</b>

[Part of our Q2 2021 Roadmap](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-roadmap-2021-c4ededc57a12) was to extend the outreach of decentralized notifications to more platforms outside mobile and this extension allows users to do exactly that, ie: get notifications from Web3 without visiting dApps to check your actions!

<blockquote>
Note: Currently itâ€™s recommended for developers and advance users to install the extension via our git. This is an alpha version so things will most likely break till they get better, the extension has been submitted to chrome store as well and we will be releasing them soon!

The EPNS Chrome Browser extension is now LIVE in the Chrome Web Store!!
