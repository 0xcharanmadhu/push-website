<!--truncate-->

Following our successful IDO launch of the Ethereum Push Notification Service governance token: **$PUSH**, we are thrilled to announce our Liquidity Rewards Program launching on **16th April**. The initial EPNS rewards program is designed to provide robust incentivizations for the $PUSH community ahead of our upcoming mainnet launch.

Users can participate in our Liquidity Rewards Program in our [EPNS staking portal](http://incentives.epns.io) in 2 ways:

1.  Staking $PUSH tokens directly on our Portal (no ETH needed except to pay gas).
2.  Staking UNI-V2 liquidity provider (LP) tokens. Users can receive LP tokens by providing liquidity to the [PUSH/ETH Uniswap pool](https://info.uniswap.org/pair/0xAf31Fd9C3B0350424BF96e551d2D1264d8466205).

> `All Community incentives are live at [https://incentives.epns.io](https://incentives.epns.io)`

A total of 5,510,000 $PUSH is allocated towards this rewards program. Participants will be able to claim their rewards by the end of each epoch (7 days). Earlier participants will earn higher rewards. The rewards program will end on **15th March 2023.**

## **Reward Distribution Keypoints:**

- Rewards are distributed as $PUSH tokens.
- Total reward is 5,510,000 $PUSH
- Allocated rewards will decrease for each sequential epoch.
- Rewards will be distributed at the end of each epoch (7 days), to be shared in % proportion to a user’s contribution to the pool.

- Staking will only be available through the official [EPNS staking portal.](http://incentives.epns.io)
