NFT TiX, the platform tokenizing event tickets as NFTs joins forces with EPNS to achieve direct communication with users of the platform. As such, users of NFT TiX are poised to receive decentralized push notifications about various upcoming events like concerts, film screenings, and festivals. These notifications will allow users to get timely access to the tickets and grab the chance of attending their favorite event.

### NFT-TiX: Reimagine Event Tickets as NFTs

NFT TiX is a decentralized marketplace that aims to bridge the gap between ticket buyers and ticket sellers in today’s world. From sporting events to film screenings and music concerts and art exhibitions, all events operate on a ticketing basis. This means that people interested in these events buy tickets to attend them. However, today’s ticketing system is not as straightforward as it seems.

There is heavy involvement of third-party ticket sellers who make the most profits and take a significant share out of the sellers’ pockets. Ticket buyers, on the other hand, end up paying more than what is required. Moreover, regular tickets come with the threat of being stolen, forged, or lost, and buyers end up missing out on their favorite events.

This is the gap that NFT TiX aims to bridge. By tokenizing tickets as NFTs, NFT TiX evades the need for third-party involvement and also ensures that the ticket truly belongs to its buyer. Apart from this, the ticket goes from being a liability to an asset that can be traded and sold anytime after the event. Special perks and incentives can also be etched into NFTs for the buyers. Industry experts believe that NFTs and the future of ticketing and NFT TiX is already taking strides in that direction.

As such, the platform needs a communication medium that keeps users updated about all the upcoming events, and EPNS aims to achieve that.

### What Does the Collaboration Entail

Through our partnership with NFT TiX, we aim to create a decentralized communication channel that allows the platform to directly interact with its users. This channel will be housed on the EPNS platform and users of NFT-TiX can subscribe to it to become beneficiaries of decentralized notifications. The notifications will be sent out whenever there is a new upcoming event of interest so that users can grab the various opportunities and attend their favorite events.

EPNS has a Chrome extension, a DAPP, and a mobile application to ensure that users do not miss out on notifications on any device.

We’re pleased to team up with NFT TiX on their journey towards reimagine tickets as NFTs and hope to continue the alliance into the future.
