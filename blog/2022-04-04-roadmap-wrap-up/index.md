### Mainnet Launch

![Fourth Image of Roadmap 2022 — Q1 Wrap up](./image-4.webp)
<ImageText>The most significant milestone on Jan 11th 2022 — Mainnet Live</ImageText>

I mean the obvious major milestone for EPNS has been the super amazing Mainnet launch! Quite a big day for all of us!

January 11, at 4 PM UTC will be etched in the echelons of EPNS history and of course, wouldn’t have been possible without the awesome support of our amazing team and all of you guys, who’re part of the EPNS Fam 💖

This is the day our protocol V1 went LIVE and when we finally deployed our contracts to the Ethereum Mainnet including a gasless experience for users, and the fact that we went ready from the get go to multi-chain

And just in the first month post our mainnet launch, our team launched an exciting

30 Channels in 30 Days campaign successfully with some real good collaborations across dapps, businesses, users, who’d want to use EPNS to reach out to their users/subscribers.

As the months went by, as of date we have around <b>51 total live channels</b> and over 44,000 Opt Ins and over <b>10,000+ unique users</b> across channels and close to 4 million notifications sent across till date!

While these numbers are fantastic, we believe all this was possible because of some major updates that took place in this quarter, and the amazing folks from the EPNS team putting their heads down and grinding it out to make this possible.

Let’s take a look at all the key updates that made this growth happen.

### Governance

In a Web3 ecosystem, Healthy governance is one where the community is actively engaged and contributing to the protocol. Whether it’s by suggestions, being active on social channels, amplifying messaging and also making governance proposals. And that’s where for EPNS, the community has always been at the forefront of the protocol.

With the launch of governance, we launched an important step towards complete decentralisation and also with a mechanism to incentivize proposers who have their proposal approved on Snapshot!

Here are some key updates of what we did w.r.t Governance!
