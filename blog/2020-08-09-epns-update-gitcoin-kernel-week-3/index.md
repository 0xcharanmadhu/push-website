# General Updates

- Our current development cycle focuses on building an alternate login flow on mobile app (using public wallet login).
- We are working on building few show runner channels on EPNS dApp like ENS domain expiry, ETH Gas price monitoring etc. We aim to complete at least 1 channel by end of this week and thereafter code review and start testing.
- We are also making important changes in our smart contract to ensure EPNS is highly scalable, and adaptable to upcoming technologies.
- Quick reminder and trying to squeeze this news back in here…..sssshhhhhh, EPNS Whitepaper v1.0 is now [**LIVE**](https://whitepaper.epns.io/). We are overwhelmed and humbled by the feedback and support from our beloved community and look forward to your continued feedback and support.
- New [website](https://epns.io/) updates ……coming soon!!!!
- To reduce efforts of tracking social media stats manually or through overly complicated tools, we created an **Automated Social Metric** Tracker at Kernel. Setting the given macros will take no more than 10 mins but after that you will have all the metrics automatically pulled and created for you.
