EPNS partners with Matic

We are excited to announce that we’ve won a grant from Matic Network and will be partnering with them to further on-chain optimization and scaling of Ethereum Push Notifications.

[Matic Network](https://matic.network/) is a Layer 2 scaling solution that achieves scale by utilizing side chains for off-chain computation while ensuring asset security using the Plasma framework and a decentralized network of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) validators.

The partnership will enable EPNS to leverage the Matic Layer-2 solution to drive high-performance and the ability to seamlessly cater to large numbers of users. Some of the core functions of EPNS includes:

- Messages from dApps, services, smart contracts
- Earning crypto
- Push notifications, and much more!
