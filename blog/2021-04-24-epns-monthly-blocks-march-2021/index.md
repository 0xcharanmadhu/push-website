This one is coming a tad late, but we wanted to share our updates with the awesome community as always. Another month has passed in the blink of an eye proving that fun never ends in the crypto-lands.

March was focused on our efforts around preparing for our Token Generation Event (TGE), let‚Äôs look at what‚Äôs been keeping us busy.

# Preparing for the big $PUSH

It took a lot on everyone‚Äôs part, and we did this as a team!

Preparing for the launch of $PUSH required orchestrating several moving pieces and making sure solid non-stop progress was being made in the correct order. These are some of the key high-level tasks involved in this process:

- Development of TGE related Smart contracts (**$PUSH** token, Staking, and Time Vesting smart contracts) and their corresponding internal auditing followed by a formal audit by the ChainSafe team ([See the official Audit results here](https://twitter.com/ChainSafeth/status/1379879154124943361)).
- Design of incentive mechanisms for participants of the protocol.
- Following all steps to ensure a successful IDO (Initial Dex Offering) launch on April 13th, 2021.
- Coordinating strategic collaborations with key players in the blockchain space to help us further refine EPNS. Announced pilot programs with ü¶Ñ [Uniswap](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1377305643384664065?s=20), [SuperFluid](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1374677663915200520?s=20) and [Gnosis](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1371816495563501577?s=20).

# EPNS 2021 Roadmap

This past month culminated a process of learning and discovery that allowed us to understand more precisely what the Ethereum ecosystem needs, and how can we best provide the right infrastructure to help.

We will soon be releasing our **Official Roadmap** together with a complementary blog post sharing more information about what we have accomplished and what‚Äôs going to be our focus for the rest of the year.

# Development

While most of our development efforts in March 21021 were around TGE, we are also getting everything ready to welcome the development community to start implementing the EPNS protocol. These are some of the key development items accomplished through March 2021:

- Development of smart contracts, granular testing scripts, and deployment scripts for all the TGE related smart contracts.
- Internal auditing of all smart contracts.
- Fixes and optimizations performed after feedback from the auditing firm.
- Front-ends for token vesting, claiming NFTs, staking and liquidity mining.
- Integration Guides including complex scenarios covering the different types of integrations. These will soon be approved for release.
- Started working on various Pilot Program EPNS implementations with our strategic partners.
- Implemented ENS/Crypto domain support.

Everything accomplished during March 2021 was only possible thanks to everyone‚Äôs support and hard work. We continue on our journey towards giving the Ethereum ecosystem one more building block to improve usability and user adoption. We couldn‚Äôt have done it without all of you.

Humbled by your support and appreciation üôèüèº,

The EPNS team.
