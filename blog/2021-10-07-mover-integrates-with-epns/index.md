For the mainstream adoption of crypto, defi, and other web3 products, there must be a simple way for people to gain access to these tools. The state of Web3 is not very user-friendly nor is it cheap to transact and implement various defi strategies in the current state of the Ethereum network. Although users like high yields, usability and accessibility remains to be a problem in the space.

Mover is an innovative company in the DeFi market that is improving upon this by building a platform that allows users to trade, store, send, and earn interest on their crypto in a simple wallet with a debit card. It acts as a permissionless and non-custodial Defi Savings account with up to 20% annual yield and $0 maintenance fees, with a Smart Treasury that covers gas expenses for users. It acts as a one-stop service for all your digital finance needs, with added user support and simple analytics to make sure youâ€™re always on your DeFi-A-game.

EPNS is glad to announce our collaboration with Mover to make Web3 user-friendly again. During our pilot program with Mover, we will integrate with Mover to:

- **Create a Mover notifications channel** that alerts users when their yield is harvested â€” This allows users of Mover to stay updated on their finances in a very intuitive and simple way without having to manually check the Mover app repeatedly.

We are excited to be working with the Mover team. We hope that this collaboration will improve the user-friendliness of Web3 applications in the space, and further empower individuals to embrace decentralized technology with ease.
