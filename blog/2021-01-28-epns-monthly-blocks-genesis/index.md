**Monthly Blocks** is our monthly update that highlights everything EPNS happening recently so you can easily stay up to date on whatâ€™s new.

This edition is not only to announce updates, but also to give insights on our upcoming events.

### EPNS 2021 Roadmap

During 2020 our team worked hard to create a solid foundation to build the new standard for Web3.0 notifications. Now we are polishing our roadmap to make sure we keep up with this hyper-fast moving space. Keep an eye on our social media as we will release it to the world very soon!

Token Generation Event
======================

Following the successful completion of our seed round, we have been working tirelessly in the preparation of our Token Generation Event (TGE). We are excited to announce that the $PUSH token will soon be available.

The $PUSH TGE is coming soon!!

**Important**: Please beware of scams. The token contract address will **only** be published in the [official EPNS Telegram](https://t.me/epnsproject) group and other official channels. When in doubt, please reach out to us on [telegram](https://t.me/epnsproject) or through other official means on the [website](https://epns.io/).

Product Updates
===============

Getting ready for an exciting 2021 is not an easy task. Our team is actively developing more tooling and infrastructure not only to our awesome users community, but also for the software development community.
