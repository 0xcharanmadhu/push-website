EPNS and the DeFi-focused educational blog TokenBrice join hands in a strategic collaboration to bring decentralized push notifications for readers. As a result, dedicated readers of TokenBrice will receive various updates about the blog and newly published articles on their devices.

### How TokenBrice is Contributing to DeFi’s Mainstream Adoption

In our perpetual collaborative efforts as an industry aiming for mainstream adoption, the importance of innovation and cutting-edge financial products cannot be overstated. However, along with innovation, it is education and awareness of DeFi that will ultimately cause people to take the plunge into this financial system. In this regard, TokenBrice is a DeFi-focused news and education blog created by active DeFi users.

The blog aims to contribute to the DeFi movement and make DeFi more accessible to people across the globe by publishing high-quality educational articles about the industry. While keeping users updated about the latest happenings of the industry, these articles are also aimed at helping new DeFi users and investors navigate through the industry and make the most of the opportunities here.

Moreover, the blog aims to uphold transparency at all costs by eliminating intrusive trackers and allowing users to follow all edits on Github Repo. To take this transparent user experience a step further, TokenBrice aims to introduce a fully decentralized medium of communication to its operations in the form of EPNS.

What Does the Collaboration Entail
==================================

As a result of TokenBrice’s collaboration with EPNS, the blog will have an official channel on the EPNS platform. This channel will enable direct, fully decentralized communication between the blog and its users without relying on centralized communication media. Dedicated readers can subscribe to this channel to receive notifications whenever new articles are published on the site.

This will allow them to stay informed with the latest happenings of the industry and grab any available opportunities. As TokenBrice continues to spread awareness about DeFi to all corners of the world, we’re pleased to team up with them on this journey and hope to continue this alliance into the future.
