EPNS and Stox, the portfolio tracker platform for DeFi, team up in a pilot collaboration to bring push notifications to users. As such, Stox will now be able to seamlessly interact with its users and keep them updated about the status of their portfolio, mainly when their NFTs are sold.

### Stox: The Portfolio Tracker
Stox is a global, all-asset portfolio tracker that allows users to track their investments in over 25 equity markets, metals, and mutual funds. However, the platform focuses on web3, allowing users to invest in and track their crypto and NFT portfolios. Investors can automatically import their Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain (BSC) trades onto the Stox platform. They can also record any transaction done on the platform.

A platform like this allows users to bring all of their under a single roof, making it easier for them to track, manage, and make adjustments to their portfolio. Stox has a beginner-friendly user interface with widgets and hashtags for quick glances. The best part is that Stox supports NFT investments and allows users to buy and sell NFTs on the platform.

### What Does the Collaboration Entail
The goal of our collaboration with Stox is the creation of a decentralized communication channel that allows direct interaction with its users. This channel will be housed on the EPNS platform and users of Stox can subscribe to it to become beneficiaries of decentralized notifications. They can expect to receive notifications whenever one of their NFTs is sold.

This saves users from having to manually check for all of these updates, which makes the platform easier to use and increases the number of people who use it. EPNS has a Chrome extension, a DAPP, and a mobile application to ensure that users do not miss out on notifications on any device.

Weâ€™re excited to strike this alliance with Stox and hope to become an integral part of their operations.
