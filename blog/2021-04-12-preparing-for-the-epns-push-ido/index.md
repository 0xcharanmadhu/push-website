text: "With the growing Ethereum ecosystem, especially DeFi, more and more users are entering the ecosystem. The main need for new users is to easily start using dApps, without having to deal with the complexities of blockchain. Biconomy plays a vital role in bringing this user experience for the masses by enabling a gasless experience for the end-users. From a dApp owner perspective, this is very valuable as plug-n-play of meta transactions using Biconomy can greatly remove any friction while onboarding new users into the ecosystem."
