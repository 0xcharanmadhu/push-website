<!--truncate-->

Giving back users full control on their identity it’s an absolute and unavoidable need. Thanks to the Web3.0 technologies users can again be the central actors controlling everything related to their identity, and this is a precious and complex concept. Decentralized identity offers a much needed solution to centralized identity and authentication systems which provide users with little security, control, or transparency.

Towards this effort, we are excited to announce that we are working with [Ceramic Network](https://ceramic.network/) to develop the core features of [EPNS](http://epns.io) protocol.We are looking forward to collaborating with the one the most innovative teams in the Web3.0 space to refine EPNS protocol to create sustainable, decentralized notifications.

Our pilot program with Ceramic will consist of:

*   Embracing Ceramic protocol and DID in EPNS protocol to enable blockchain agonistic behavior for receiving nodes of EPNS.
*   Working with the Ceramic team to enable technical discussion towards building the decentralized communication layer that is scalable and powerful.
*   Exploring / creating together a standard for Ceramic protocol that can enable sending notifications through a user’s DID, with routing preferences managed in Ceramic’s [IDX](http://idx.xyz) identity protocol

Ceramic Network plays a critical role in the development of the entire ecosystem, bringing decentralized identity and open data to life. It is for us a pleasure and an honor to have the opportunity to work with this amazing team to help reclaim the web.

**About Ceramic Network**
-------------------------

Ceramic is a decentralized network for managing and processing mutable information on the open web. By combining IPFS, libp2p, blockchain, DIDs, and standards for authenticated data, Ceramic gives developers the ability to build completely serverless and silo-free applications using dynamic, verifiable, decentralized data.
