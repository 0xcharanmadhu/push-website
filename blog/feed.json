Today, the launch of the token-gated Group Chat on the UD messaging platform is another step towards decentralized, open, censorship-resistant communication for the future of the web. At launch, UD Group messaging will go live with <b>400+ Groups, for 3.8M+ UD users</b>.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"group-chat-a-shift-in-decentralized-communication\">Group Chat: A Shift in Decentralized Communication<a href=\"https://push.org/blog/announcing-group-chat-from-push-unstoppable#group-chat-a-shift-in-decentralized-communication\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Group Chat: A Shift in Decentralized Communication\" title=\"Direct link to Group Chat: A Shift in Decentralized Communication\">​</a></h3>\n<p>Currently, UD’s messaging interface <a href=\"https://unstoppabledomains.com/blog/categories/announcements/article/messaging-launch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Unstoppable Messaging</a> allows any web3 user to message addresses belonging to a .eth, .x, .crypto domain, .polygon along with many other domains. However, Unstoppable Messaging has been limited to just one-to-one and one-to-many messaging. As such, we’ve been working with Unstoppable Domains to enable a robust, token-gated system through badges, allowing anyone with a <a href=\"https://support.unstoppabledomains.com/support/solutions/articles/48001215751-badges\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">badge</a> to join a Group Chat and start a conversation.</p>\n<p>By blending UD’s expertise in web3 domain services with Push Protocol’s market-leading decentralized messaging technology, we’re excited to release this all-new feature to the web3 community.</p>\n<blockquote><i><p>“Our partnership with Unstoppable is not merely about changing the way teams communicate; it's about revolutionizing it. 'Group Chat' embodies our dedication to empowering organizations with cutting-edge communication technology.\"</p></i><b>— Harsh Rajat, Founder at Push Protocol</b></blockquote>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"what-are-token-gated-group-chats\">What Are Token Gated Group Chats<a href=\"https://push.org/blog/announcing-group-chat-from-push-unstoppable#what-are-token-gated-group-chats\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to What Are Token Gated Group Chats\" title=\"Direct link to What Are Token Gated Group Chats\">​</a></h3>\n<p>Token-gated Group Chats are exactly what their name implies, Group Chats that require you to hold a specific token (NFT or crypto-asset) to either access any given group, or message within it. Token-gating your Group Chats is a surefire way of controlling who can enter your chats and who can message within them. As the admin of your Group Chat, you can set and adjust permissions whenever you like.</p>\n<p>For businesses, organizations, and teams, it’s a fantastic way to ensure your communication channels remain private and secure by giving you total control over who enters and participates in the communication channel.</p>\n<p>You can learn more about <a href=\"https://push.org/docs/chat/build/conditional-rules-for-group/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Token-Gated/Conditional Group Chats here</a>.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"getting-started-with-ud-group-chat\">Getting Started With UD Group Chat<a href=\"https://push.org/blog/announcing-group-chat-from-push-unstoppable#getting-started-with-ud-group-chat\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Getting Started With UD Group Chat\" title=\"Direct link to Getting Started With UD Group Chat\">​</a></h3>\n<p>Getting started with Push Protocol x Unstoppable Domains Group Chat is simple — you either need to join an existing Group Chat or create your own.</p>\n<p>Every Group Chat is associated with a ‘<a href=\"https://support.unstoppabledomains.com/support/solutions/articles/48001215751-badges\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">badge</a>’ and hence token-gated based on badge ownership.</p>\n<p>At launch, every UD badge that exists will have its own Group Chat (currently 400+ Group Chats are live).

The mission of the campaign was simple – to provide developers the opportunity to create real-world impact by giving them a hard problem to solve from leading protocols. This of course included rewards.</p>\n<p>To create a variety of challenges, we teamed up with 12 of the most prominent protocols in web3 including Ethereum Foundation, ETHGlobal, Polygon, Filecoin, The Graph, Aragon, Timeswap, Alchemy, Shardeum, Flipkart, Biconomy, and Chainsafe to create a running hackathon.</p>\n<p>Each partner in the BRB hackathon presented their own unique Coding Challenge – a complex problem with a substantial bounty for the builder who could solve it.</p>\n<p>Today, we're thrilled to announce that 2 of these Coding Challenges have been solved!</p>\n<p>Here are the 2 challenges, the importance behind each of them, and the masterminds behind the game-changing solutions.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"quantum-proofing-ethereum-network--solved-by-aditya-bisht\">Quantum-proofing Ethereum Network – solved by Aditya Bisht<a href=\"https://push.org/blog/announcing-winners-of-billion-reasons#quantum-proofing-ethereum-network--solved-by-aditya-bisht\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Quantum-proofing Ethereum Network – solved by Aditya Bisht\" title=\"Direct link to Quantum-proofing Ethereum Network – solved by Aditya Bisht\">​</a></h3>\n<p>Coding Challenge Owner: <a href=\"https://ethereum.foundation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ethereum Foundation</a></p>\n<p>Challenge: Figure out a way to quantum-proof the Ethereum Network, read more <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/pushprotocol/Ethereum-Foundation-07179dcf7f7e44efb7d2b2c9d2296264?pvs=4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n<p>Winning Builder: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bisht__13\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Aditya Bisht</a></p>\n<p>Quantum computing is a looming threat to blockchain networks. Its powerful computing capabilities mean it can be used to reverse-engineer secret keys from public keys. To retain security and integrity in the Ethereum Network, the challenge was presented to find a way to quantum-proof the network using account abstraction.</p>\n<p>We’d like to congratulate <b>Aditya Bisht</b> for successfully solving the challenge and contributing to the security and robustness of the Ethereum Network.</p>\n<p>He shared his excitement with us – “Faced with intriguing complexities and the convergence of overlapping domains, the challenge not only pushed the boundaries but also contributed to advancing the ZK domain. Immense gratitude to the mentors from the Ethereum foundation and the unwavering support from Push.

But keeping track of which wallets have which permissions can be confusing, not to mention how easy it is to lose track of these permissions across a single DAO. As such, the problem statement required a builder to find a way that enables a DAO to efficiently manage permissions.</p>\n<p>With that, we’d like to congratulate Samuel Mens who built two plugins and a UI that allow you to manage both subDAOs and NFT-based permissions using <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hatsprotocol\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@hatsprotocol</a> and Aragon OSx. For all DAOs that are built using Aragon, there is now a whole new level of on-chain governance management tools available.</p>\n<blockquote><i><p>\"I've been part of the Aragon community since their launch of OSx and have built several plugins. I had this idea for a pretty ambitious plugin, which alligned very well with the BRB Hackathon bounty.

Our ecosystem expanded as more protocols started using Push to send notifications / chat to their users across chains. Push is now live on 5 chains including Ethereum, Polygon zKEVM, PoS, Arbitrum and BNB.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Notification data for Push Protocol growth\" src=\"https://push.org/assets/images/subscribers2023-74aa2b76587930e6025526f4701bc22a.png\" width=\"1600\" height=\"840\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p>\n<h2 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"highlights\">Highlights<a href=\"https://push.org/blog/push-roadmap-recap-2023#highlights\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Highlights\" title=\"Direct link to Highlights\">​</a></h2>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"unified-push-sdk\">Unified Push SDK<a href=\"https://push.org/blog/push-roadmap-recap-2023#unified-push-sdk\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Unified Push SDK\" title=\"Direct link to Unified Push SDK\">​</a></h3>\n<p>Push launched a unified SDK for web3 developers to send <a title=\"Explore Push Notifications Protocol\" href=\"https://push.org/docs/notifications/\"><strong>notifications</strong></a> or <a title=\"Explore Push Chat Protocol\" href=\"https://push.org/docs/chat/\"><strong>chats</strong></a> to their users with unification of the SDK, with <strong>video</strong> and <strong>spaces</strong> support coming soon!</p>\n<p>This enabled Push API class that is common for all suite of products by Push enabling developers to use Push products with ease.

In essence, Push Chat makes messaging in web3 as seamless as it is in web2. One feature we’ve been working on extensively within Push Chat is Push Group Chat, the ability to host conversations with multiple members.</p>\n<p>Whether you're chatting in public groups, enjoying more private discussions, or joining token-gated communities, Push Group Chat makes connecting with others simple and secure. But now, Push is levelling up its scalability and increasing group limits into the thousands. Let's dive into the enhanced possibilities and expanded horizons that await this enhanced Push Group Chat!</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"from-15k-to-25k-members-in-a-single-group-chat-\">From 1.5k to 25k Members in a Single Group Chat! 🔥<a href=\"https://push.org/blog/hyper-scalable-group-chats#from-15k-to-25k-members-in-a-single-group-chat-\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to From 1.5k to 25k Members in a Single Group Chat! 🔥\" title=\"Direct link to From 1.5k to 25k Members in a Single Group Chat! 🔥\">​</a></h3>\n<p>Group Chat platforms have always struggled with the number of participants a single group could accommodate. This limitation has hindered the potential for large-scale user interactions and hence restricted how Group Chats can be used to connect with a broader audience. Introducing our newly enhanced Push Group Chat. We’re calling it \"hyper scalable\" in reference to Push Group Chat’s newfound ability to handle significantly larger group sizes, transcending its prior  limitations. This enhancement signifies a major development for web3-native user interactions , empowering users to engage in more extensive and inclusive group conversations like never before.</p>\n<p>With hyper scalability, Push Group Chat has transformed the landscape of group conversations. Public group limits have skyrocketed from 1500 to an impressive 25,000 members. Similarly, private groups once capped at 50 members, now support up to 5,000 participants. These substantial increases are redefining the potential for group interactions in web3 and  reflect Push Group Chat's commitment to delivering a more dynamic and accommodating messaging experience.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"push-chat-challenging-web2-incumbents\">Push Chat Challenging Web2 Incumbents<a href=\"https://push.org/blog/hyper-scalable-group-chats#push-chat-challenging-web2-incumbents\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Push Chat Challenging Web2 Incumbents\" title=\"Direct link to Push Chat Challenging Web2 Incumbents\">​</a></h3>\n<p>Instant communication has long been dominated by traditional Web2 chat applications like WhatsApp and Signal, but Push Chat is here to challenge that. While the incumbents rely on centralised architectures that leave user data susceptible to potential vulnerabilities, Push Chat pioneers a decentralised approach, ensuring end-to-end encryption and placing control back into the hands of users.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the introduction of hyper scalability in Push Chat takes the competitive edge to new heights. In contrast to the confined group sizes enforced by WhatsApp and Signal, where limitations are approximately 1000 members, Push Chat shatters these constraints by accommodating a staggering 25k members for public groups and 5k for private groups.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"push-chat-benchmarks-letting-the-numbers-speak-for-unprecedented-scale-and-security\">Push Chat Benchmarks: Letting The Numbers Speak For Unprecedented Scale And Security<a href=\"https://push.org/blog/hyper-scalable-group-chats#push-chat-benchmarks-letting-the-numbers-speak-for-unprecedented-scale-and-security\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Push Chat Benchmarks: Letting The Numbers Speak For Unprecedented Scale And Security\" title=\"Direct link to Push Chat Benchmarks: Letting The Numbers Speak For Unprecedented Scale And Security\">​</a></h3>\n<table><tbody><tr><th><p>Public Group Size</p></th><th><p>Time Taken for Sending Message ( ms )</p></th></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>192</td></tr><tr><td>50</td><td>170</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>110</td></tr><tr><td>250</td><td>103</td></tr><tr><td>500</td><td>104</td></tr><tr><td>1K</td><td>107</td></tr><tr><td>2.5K</td><td>117</td></tr><tr><td>5K</td><td>167</td></tr><tr><td>10K</td><td>156</td></tr><tr><td>15K</td><td>198</td></tr><tr><td>25K</td><td>343</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table><tbody><tr><th><p>Public Group Size</p></th><th><p>Time Taken for Joining Grp ( ms )</p></th></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>101</td></tr><tr><td>50</td><td>111</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>128</td></tr><tr><td>250</td><td>125</td></tr><tr><td>500</td><td>199</td></tr><tr><td>1K</td><td>190</td></tr><tr><td>2.5K</td><td>328</td></tr><tr><td>5K</td><td>449</td></tr><tr><td>10K</td><td>609</td></tr><tr><td>15K</td><td>803</td></tr><tr><td>25K</td><td>1109</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table><tbody><tr><th><p>Private Group Size</p></th><th><p>Time Taken for Sending Message ( ms )</p></th></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>300</td></tr><tr><td>50</td><td>170</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>169</td></tr><tr><td>250</td><td>193</td></tr><tr><td>500</td><td>231</td></tr><tr><td>1K</td><td>295</td></tr><tr><td>2.5K</td><td>539</td></tr><tr><td>5K</td><td>868</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<table><tbody><tr><th><p>Private Group Size</p></th><th><p>Time Taken for Joining Grp ( ms )</p></th></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>287</td></tr><tr><td>50</td><td>312</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>312</td></tr><tr><td>250</td><td>481</td></tr><tr><td>500</td><td>711</td></tr><tr><td>1K</td><td>1192</td></tr><tr><td>2.5K</td><td>5153</td></tr><tr><td>5K</td><td>12769</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"whats-made-hyper-scalability-possible\">What’s Made Hyper Scalability Possible?<a href=\"https://push.org/blog/hyper-scalable-group-chats#whats-made-hyper-scalability-possible\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to What’s Made Hyper Scalability Possible?\" title=\"Direct link to What’s Made Hyper Scalability Possible?\">​</a></h3>\n<p>In the relentless pursuit of hyper scalability, Push Chat has had to undergo transformational advancements at both the architectural and encryption levels.</p>\n<p>Previously, each message within private groups underwent encryption using the private keys of all group members, resulting in encryption complexity directly proportional to the number of participants.</p>\n<p>Contrastingly, the platform has been upgraded to now dynamically generate session keys and encrypted secrets during every pivotal group state change, such as adding, removing, or joining members. Push Chat ensures that the time-consuming aspect of the encryption process is reserved for moments when the group dynamic undergoes significant transformations. This innovative approach ensures that the encryption process for private group messages remains constant, irrespective of the group's size. By dissociating encryption complexity from the number of participants, Push Chat has effectively eliminated the scalability concerns associated with larger private groups.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"but-waitmore-enhancements-are-on-the-way\">But Wait…More Enhancements Are On The Way!<a href=\"https://push.org/blog/hyper-scalable-group-chats#but-waitmore-enhancements-are-on-the-way\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to But Wait…More Enhancements Are On The Way!\" title=\"Direct link to But Wait…More Enhancements Are On The Way!\">​</a></h3>\n<p>We are not stopping at 5k members. We have already made the breakthrough to take this to <b>100,000</b> benchmarked members 😱 for both private and public group chats. The only caveat is that it breaks backward compatibility when messages using the newer architecture are read by older SDKs.</p>\n<p>To address this, we have decided to implement these changes in two phases:\nIncorporate all functionalities that understand the new architecture in Push SDK from 1.4.45 upwards. Devs just need to update to start supporting the reading of those formats.\nThe use of the feature flags in the SDK (See below or ask on Discord as to how to enable that: <a href=\"https://discord.gg/pushprotocol\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://discord.gg/pushprotocol</a>) enables the new standard as the default allowing devs to tap into it and use that in case they want.</p>\n<p>So, what do you have to do to update this functionality?</p>\n<p>Only one thing: Update the SDK to the latest version (1.4.45 or upwards), that’s it! This will ensure that messages sent using the new message standards are understood and displayed correctly in your dApp / mobile app / etc.</p>\n<h4 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"how-to-enable-push-sdk-feature-flag\">How to enable Push SDK Feature Flag<a href=\"https://push.org/blog/hyper-scalable-group-chats#how-to-enable-push-sdk-feature-flag\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to How to enable Push SDK Feature Flag\" title=\"Direct link to How to enable Push SDK Feature Flag\">​</a></h4>\n<p>In-depth details for how to enable this can be found in the <a href=\"https://push.org/docs/chat/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Push Chat documentation</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/push-sdk/tree/main/packages/restapi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GitHub repository</a>.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"push-sdk-v2-is-coming\">Push SDK V2 is Coming<a href=\"https://push.org/blog/hyper-scalable-group-chats#push-sdk-v2-is-coming\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Push SDK V2 is Coming\" title=\"Direct link to Push SDK V2 is Coming\">​</a></h3>\n<p>We are also thrilled to announce that we are working on the V2 version of the SDK which will ensure a standardized Push user class that enables unified access to notifications, chat, video, spaces, and more!</p>\n<p>Apart from this, the V2 version will have more streamlined response objects and faster calls though it will break backward compatibility which is why we will transition slowly to the new SDK.</p>\n<p>We recommend joining our Discord server (<a href=\"https://discord.gg/pushprotocol\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://discord.gg/pushprotocol</a>) -&gt; #dev-announcements channel for information on how to upgrade / best practices / changelog.</p>",

Channel Owners now have the ability to segment and categorize different notifications and Channel Subscribers now have the ability to select notifications that match their preferences.</p>\n<p>Just as you might customize notifications through “Advanced Notifications Settings” on your favorite web2 mobile apps, Notification Settings through Push brings a similar level of personalization to web3-native subscribers.</p>\n<p>So, how do Notification Settings work for both Channel Owners and Channel Subscribers? We’ll walk you through everything there is to know.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"notification-settings-for-channel-owners\">Notification Settings for Channel Owners<a href=\"https://push.org/blog/introducing-notification-settings#notification-settings-for-channel-owners\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Notification Settings for Channel Owners\" title=\"Direct link to Notification Settings for Channel Owners\">​</a></h3>\n<p>Push is a thriving community with hundreds of diverse channels spanning DeFi, gaming, web3 media, and beyond. These channels often have a wide range of content, notifications, and updates to share with their users.</p>\n<p>For example, a DeFi channel might want to send various notifications like loan liquidation alerts, price alerts, or governance proposal notifications. Just as a newsletter might want to send notifications for new articles in its blog, but wouldn’t want to send every article to every subscriber.</p>\n<p>With Notification Settings, Channel Owners can now define specific categories for their notifications. Consequently, when a channel triggers a notification for that specific category, only the users who've opted for that preference will receive a notification.</p>\n<p>There are two types of channel settings for Channel Owners:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>True/False Notification Settings: The first channel setting lets you set up a channel with a simple true/false trigger setting. For instance, say your channel covers web3 news. You can define settings for categories of articles like  \"tech\" and “partnership announcements” and give users the option to turn each On (true) or Off (false). Adding one of these Notification Settings for every content category gives end-users the option to opt-in for content categories that match their preferences and avoid ones that don’t.</li>\n<li>Range Value Notification Settings: The second channel setting lets you set up a range of values for a specific category that might trigger a notification. For instance, say you want to set up a Notification Setting that triggers when the price of ETH passes a given value. You can simply create a range, say from 0-10,000 and subscribers will be able to select any value within that range to set their custom ETH price notification.\nYou can set as many or as few Notification Settings for your channel as you like.\nHere’s how it looks.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Introducing Notification Settings\" src=\"https://push.org/assets/images/image-1-8ad26187a9265c58c87b6bc0fa7eda4c.webp\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"img_ev3q\">\n</p><div class=\"SharedStyling__ImageText-sc-1enui31-28 hZhFkJ\"><b>Caption:</b> This channel has 5 Notification Settings. 4 of which are True/False Notification Settings and 1 of which is a Range Value Notification Setting. As such, end-users will have the choice to toggle on/off preferences for each of these 5 notifications separately.</div><p></p>\n<p>Note, each channel will also set a ‘default value’ setting. This ensures subscribers who opt-in without specifying their preferences will simply receive notifications based on the channel's default settings.</p>\n<p>For builders looking to integrate Notification Settings, you can find all the relevant and associated documentation here</p>\n<p>👉 <a href=\"https://push.org/docs/notifications/build/create-channel-settings/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://push.org/docs/notifications/build/create-channel-settings/</a></p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"notification-settings-for-channel-subscribers\">Notification Settings for Channel Subscribers<a href=\"https://push.org/blog/introducing-notification-settings#notification-settings-for-channel-subscribers\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Notification Settings for Channel Subscribers\" title=\"Direct link to Notification Settings for Channel Subscribers\">​</a></h3>\n<p>Empowering Channel Subscribers (end-users) to personalize their notifications is a massive step towards a more user-centric and user-friendly web3 experience. Channel Subscribers can filter out notifications they aren't interested in receiving to reduce notification clutter. This optimizes user inboxes, reduces spam, and helps personalize the user experience.</p>\n<p>Here’s how it works for Channel Subscribers:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>When you subscribe to a channel that has enabled Notification Settings, you’ll have the option to personalize your notification preferences based on the available settings the Channel Owner has preset.\nThe choice to customize is optional. You can always opt-in for the ‘default values’ of a channel (these ‘default value’ notifications are determined by the Channel Owner).\nOnce you’ve selected your preferences for all of the Notification Settings, you can click ‘opt-in’ to initiate the subscription and begin receiving notifications!\nThis is how the UI will prompt you to select your choice of notification for the channel:</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Introducing Notification Settings\" src=\"https://push.org/assets/images/image-3-e4c5f8b2e778f80daf25fcab4f7e8436.webp\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"img_ev3q\">\n</p><div class=\"SharedStyling__ImageText-sc-1enui31-28 hZhFkJ\"><b>Caption:</b> For this channel, there are 4 available Notification Settings to pick from. 3 settings correspond to simple on-off toggles and 1 corresponds to a range value. For this range value setting, you can set any value (price) that you want to receive notifications for within that range.</div><p></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>You can review all the channels you are receiving notifications for and manage those settings directly within your “Notification Settings” tab. This dashboard gives you a complete birds-eye-view of all your notifications and lets you edit and change your settings any time at no cost.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Introducing Notification Settings\" src=\"https://push.org/assets/images/image-2-f1ca5660f4cd782b09eb84cc5b3d7528.webp\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p>\n<p>Here are a few popular channels to get you started!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://app.push.org/channels?channel=0xB88460Bb2696CAb9D66013A05dFF29a28330689D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Push Protocol</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://app.push.org/channels?channel=0x03EAAAa48ea78d1E66eA3458364d553AD981871E\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BTC Price Tracker</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://app.push.org/channels?channel=0xDBc5936E4daaE94F415C39D284f6a69c4d553F2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ETH Price Tracker</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Full list of Push channels 👉<a href=\"https://app.push.org/channels\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://app.push.org/channels</a></p>\n<p>Here’s a full demo on how to both setup and sign up for Notification Settings:</p>\n<div class=\"SharedStyling__VideoContainer-sc-1enui31-32 irRNYt\"><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\" style=\"border-radius:32px\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XDJFnfzVxsQ\" title=\"Introducing Notification Settings: Customize Your Web3 Notifications🔔⚙️\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe></div>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"pushing-personalized-communication-experiences\">Pushing Personalized Communication Experiences<a href=\"https://push.org/blog/introducing-notification-settings#pushing-personalized-communication-experiences\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Pushing Personalized Communication Experiences\" title=\"Direct link to Pushing Personalized Communication Experiences\">​</a></h3>\n<p>Notification Settings is a game-changer.</p>\n<p>For Channel Owners that want to provide the best level of control and personalization for their users, Notification Settings mean being able to now categorize notifications and updates to only give users information they want.</p>\n<p>For Channel Subscribers that want a personalized and engaging user experience, Notification Settings mean being able to accommodate their personal preferences.\nAt Push, we’re constantly reaffirming our commitment to decentralizing communication and onboarding the next one billion users to web3.
