This is why many modern blockchains and protocols have tight discussions on what it means to be fully decentralized.</p>\n<p>So to begin with, we’ll explore the different types of architecture at a high level as a way of best communicating what Push is working towards</p>\n<p>Client-Server – Linear system <br>\nDistributed – Different nodes hold different responsibilities and contribute to one another <br>\nPeer-toPeer – Data is passed directly from user to user with no intermediaries<br>\nDecentralized – Collective and shared control over data and decision making<br></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"First Image of Explaining Push Nodes: Everything You Need To Know\" src=\"https://push.org/assets/images/image-1-cc99b36c89e8bfc06d5a59b599e5d50c.webp\" width=\"1160\" height=\"652\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p>\n<p>As we’ve outlined in the image above, Push is moving towards the right. A fully decentralized network wherein no single node or entity has complete control of the network. Access is open and shared.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind, decentralization can also be applied at different layers of an organization. Just as you can decentralize software architecture, you too can decentralize teams and organizational structures (DAOs).</p>\n<p>While the Push Network already has a DAO and $PUSH token, we are now taking the final step towards decentralization by decentralizing our software architecture, completing what you might call ‘full stack decentralization’.</p>\n<p>Our goal is to build a permissionless, trustless, proof-of-stake protocol with different node types that provide a decentralized API for notifications processing, indexing, and delivery. Ultimately, we’re aiming to wrap the whole system in a developer-friendly SDK package and a dApp that can leverage the power of this network.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"push-nodes-as-the-key-how-do-they-work\">Push Nodes As The Key: How Do They Work<a href=\"https://push.org/blog/explaining-push-nodes#push-nodes-as-the-key-how-do-they-work\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Push Nodes As The Key: How Do They Work\" title=\"Direct link to Push Nodes As The Key: How Do They Work\">​</a></h3>\n<p>The Push Network will comprise three different types of Nodes. This includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Validator nodes - Batching notifications into blocks, validating them, and providing all the required APIs for SDK</li>\n<li>Storage nodes - Indexing notifications</li>\n<li>Delivery nodes - Sending notifications to the end-user device based on his/her 0xwallet, not his/her hardware credentials.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The network is guarded by a smart contract to maintain node staking and slashing. This is where the PUSH token is used.</p>\n<p>In our proposed architecture, the storage network is sharded by a smart contract, which assigns specific shards to specific nodes to ensure a high amount of redundancy. This is done on top of storage nodes.</p>\n<p>We’re targeting fast delivery of ~15s on average for delivery of Notifications.</p>\n<p>Abstract architecture</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Second Image of Explaining Push Nodes: Everything You Need To Know\" src=\"https://push.org/assets/images/image-2-f582d599b661dca47be6741aee109046.webp\" width=\"1160\" height=\"652\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p>\n<p>The basic use-case:</p>\n<p>A javascript SDK locates the right validator, posts a notification, and this notification will be included in the block. The block list of validator nodes for processing is determined by a combined network random number (randao).</p>\n<p>A more detailed version of the architecture looks like this:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Third Image of Explaining Push Nodes: Everything You Need To Know\" src=\"https://push.org/assets/images/image-3-284130ae22160c8ce52d0c9e8af25261.webp\" width=\"1160\" height=\"647\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p>\n<p>We’ll now explore each of the three Node types in more detail.</p>\n<h4 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"validator-nodes\">Validator Nodes<a href=\"https://push.org/blog/explaining-push-nodes#validator-nodes\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Validator Nodes\" title=\"Direct link to Validator Nodes\">​</a></h4>\n<p>Every validator can be slashed, in case his vote on the new block differs from the majority of their validators, which voted for the block as valid.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Fourth Image of Explaining Push Nodes: Everything You Need To Know\" src=\"https://push.org/assets/images/image-4-60068ed2b000a58006e79291b702234f.webp\" width=\"1157\" height=\"647\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p>\n<h4 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"storage-nodes\">Storage nodes<a href=\"https://push.org/blog/explaining-push-nodes#storage-nodes\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Storage nodes\" title=\"Direct link to Storage nodes\">​</a></h4>\n<p>Originally, Push Storage Nodes validate and index all communications and link them to a user’s wallet address and multi-chain identity.</p>\n<p>The new Push decentralized system maps every wallet notification data to a specific shard.</p>\n<p>This shard maintains X copies in the network.

They ensure notifications are securely and efficiently delivered to the end-user’s device while serving as a decentralized solution for connecting web3 and web2. These nodes can be hosted by trusted third parties, bringing reliability and professionalism to the system. Their operation hinges on a few key principles and functionalities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Integration with Established APIs</b>: To leverage robust, widely-accepted infrastructure for sending Push Notifications.</li>\n<li><b>Privacy-Centric Mapping</b>: To maintain the privacy and security of the users, delivery nodes store a mapping between a registered crypto wallet and the end-user device ID.</li>\n<li><b>Hosting by Trusted Entities</b>: Recognizing the importance of reliability and trust in the notification delivery process, delivery nodes can be hosted by trusted third parties.</li>\n<li><b>Collaboration with Wallet Providers</b>: In addition to being hosted by trusted third parties, delivery nodes can also be hosted by wallet providers themselves. This collaboration brings an added layer of integration and convenience, as wallet providers have a direct interest in ensuring that their users receive notifications promptly and securely.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Seventh Image of Explaining Push Nodes: Everything You Need To Know\" src=\"https://push.org/assets/images/image-7-c0907aebeea7cce896713dc8030d04b8.webp\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1124\" class=\"img_ev3q\"></p>\n<h4 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"why-push-nodes-why-decentralization\">Why Push Nodes?

Builders should have open and free access to enhance their dApps with web3-native communication, without needing to rely on centralized providers.</p>\n<p>As an extension of this, those same builders should not just have access to these tools, but a say in how these tools get developed and improved over time.</p>\n<p>As the accessibility of these tools grows, so does the quality of dApps that build with them. When we achieve the goal of building better projects, we move closer towards a reality where we can onboard the next billion users to web3.</p>\n<p>We are excited for this new era for the Push Protocol Network and we are extremely excited to have you be a part of it.</p>\n<p>For more questions or queries, join us in Discord 👉<a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/pushprotocol\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://discord.com/invite/pushprotocol</a></p>\n<p>You can also get started building with Push tools 👉<a href=\"https://push.org/docs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://push.org/docs/</a></p>",

Essentially, Push Chat bridges the gap between messaging in web3 and web2, offering a hassle-free transition. One pivotal enhancement we've diligently pursued within Push Chat involves reconfiguring the architecture for storing and retrieving messages, resulting in significantly faster performance.</p>\n<p>Whether you're engaging in public group chats, participating in private discussions, or accessing token-gated communities, Push Group Chat simplifies and secures connections. Now, Push is elevating its scalability and drastically improving message transmission speeds.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"understanding-push-chat-message-architecture\">Understanding Push Chat Message Architecture<a href=\"https://push.org/blog/benchmarking-push-chat-message#understanding-push-chat-message-architecture\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Understanding Push Chat Message Architecture\" title=\"Direct link to Understanding Push Chat Message Architecture\">​</a></h3>\n<h4 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"v1-architecture\">V1 Architecture<a href=\"https://push.org/blog/benchmarking-push-chat-message#v1-architecture\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to V1 Architecture\" title=\"Direct link to V1 Architecture\">​</a></h4>\n<p>In the earlier iteration of Push Chat, messages were managed within a linked list structure. This architecture employed references where each message pointed to the previous one, creating a sequential chain of messages. However, this design encountered some significant hurdles.</p>\n<p>One notable issue arose from the concurrent arrival of messages, as the linked list format struggled to handle the concurrent processing of incoming messages. This concurrency bottleneck often resulted in performance degradation and dropping of messages by Push nodes, undermining the real-time nature of Push Chat.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the process of retrieving messages from this linked list structure posed its own set of challenges. Since Push nodes primarily stored references to the latest message, retrieving older messages required traversing the entire linked list sequentially. This approach led to slow query speeds, as resolving previous messages necessitated the resolution of the current message first.</p>\n<h4 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"v2-architecture\">V2 Architecture<a href=\"https://push.org/blog/benchmarking-push-chat-message#v2-architecture\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to V2 Architecture\" title=\"Direct link to V2 Architecture\">​</a></h4>\n<p>In the latest iteration, Push Chat has undergone a significant architectural transformation, one of the most notable changes in v2 is the abandonment of the linked list paradigm, where each message no longer references the previous one.</p>\n<p>By eliminating the requirement for messages to reference the previous one, v2 architecture significantly simplifies message processing, enabling Push nodes to handle concurrent messages more efficiently. This architectural shift has alleviated the concurrency bottleneck that plagued the earlier version, enhancing the scalability and responsiveness of Push Chat.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, in v2, Push nodes now cache every message instead of solely storing references to the latest message hash. This strategic enhancement plays a pivotal role in optimizing message retrieval speeds. By caching every message, Push nodes can swiftly access and deliver messages upon request, mitigating the latency issues associated with sequential message resolution.</p>\n<p>It's worth noting that despite these architectural changes, the fundamental immutable layer of Push Chat remains rooted in IPFS. Every message, whether in v1 or v2, continues to be backed up by a client-signed and verifiable verification proof. This cryptographic mechanism ensures the integrity and authenticity of messages, safeguarding them against tampering or unauthorized alterations.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"push-chat-benchmarks-letting-the-numbers-speak-for-unprecedented-scale-and-security\">Push Chat Benchmarks: Letting The Numbers Speak For Unprecedented Scale And Security<a href=\"https://push.org/blog/benchmarking-push-chat-message#push-chat-benchmarks-letting-the-numbers-speak-for-unprecedented-scale-and-security\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Push Chat Benchmarks: Letting The Numbers Speak For Unprecedented Scale And Security\" title=\"Direct link to Push Chat Benchmarks: Letting The Numbers Speak For Unprecedented Scale And Security\">​</a></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note:: It's important to acknowledge that the benchmarking of v2 architecture was conducted on a development server, while the benchmarking of v1 architecture took place on a production server. It's worth highlighting that the production server possesses 16 times more CPU power than the development server, potentially providing an unfair advantage to v1 architecture. Additionally, it's crucial to recognize that the traffic volume on the production server is substantially higher compared to the development environment. These discrepancies in server specifications and traffic levels should be considered when interpreting the benchmark results.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"list-paginated-user-chats\">List Paginated User Chats<a href=\"https://push.org/blog/benchmarking-push-chat-message#list-paginated-user-chats\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to List Paginated User Chats\" title=\"Direct link to List Paginated User Chats\">​</a></h4>\n<p>Fn Breakdown</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Fetch lists of chat of a account with latest threadhash ( Page Limit = 10 ) -

Today, the launch of the token-gated Group Chat on the UD messaging platform is another step towards decentralized, open, censorship-resistant communication for the future of the web. At launch, UD Group messaging will go live with <b>400+ Groups, for 3.8M+ UD users</b>.</p>\n<h3 class=\"anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5\" id=\"group-chat-a-shift-in-decentralized-communication\">Group Chat: A Shift in Decentralized Communication<a href=\"https://push.org/blog/announcing-group-chat-from-push-unstoppable#group-chat-a-shift-in-decentralized-communication\" class=\"hash-link\" aria-label=\"Direct link to Group Chat: A Shift in Decentralized Communication\" title=\"Direct link to Group Chat: A Shift in Decentralized Communication\">​</a></h3>\n<p>Currently, UD’s messaging interface <a href=\"https://unstoppabledomains.com/blog/categories/announcements/article/messaging-launch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Unstoppable Messaging</a> allows any web3 user to message addresses belonging to a .eth, .x, .crypto domain, .polygon along with many other domains. However, Unstoppable Messaging has been limited to just one-to-one and one-to-many messaging. As such, we’ve been working with Unstoppable Domains to enable a robust, token-gated system through badges, allowing anyone with a <a href=\"https://support.unstoppabledomains.com/support/solutions/articles/48001215751-badges\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">badge</a> to join a Group Chat and start a conversation.</p>\n<p>By blending UD’s expertise in web3 domain services with Push Protocol’s market-leading decentralized messaging technology, we’re excited to release this all-new feature to the web3 community.</p>\n<blockquote><i><p>“Our partnership with Unstoppable is not merely about changing the way teams communicate; it's about revolutionizing it.

But keeping track of which wallets have which permissions can be confusing, not to mention how easy it is to lose track of these permissions across a single DAO. As such, the problem statement required a builder to find a way that enables a DAO to efficiently manage permissions.</p>\n<p>With that, we’d like to congratulate Samuel Mens who built two plugins and a UI that allow you to manage both subDAOs and NFT-based permissions using <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hatsprotocol\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@hatsprotocol</a> and Aragon OSx. For all DAOs that are built using Aragon, there is now a whole new level of on-chain governance management tools available.</p>\n<blockquote><i><p>\"I've been part of the Aragon community since their launch of OSx and have built several plugins.
