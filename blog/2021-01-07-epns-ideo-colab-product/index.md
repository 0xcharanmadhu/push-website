It took us sometime to write this post, but finally here it is ðŸ˜…!!

Ethereum Push Notification Service([EPNS](https://epns.io/)) was selected for **I**[**DEO CoLab Ventures**](https://twitter.com/IDEOVC)**â€™ Product Validation Day (PVD)** on June 18, 2020. Out of the 120+ teams who applied, thrilled to share that we were [accepted](https://medium.com/ideo-colab/announcing-ideos-product-validation-day-for-defi-founders-79e5668f9e3c) to join the prestigious design-thinking event!

**IDEO has run the program with some of the top crypto and DeFi teams in the world, including** [**Compound**](https://compound.finance/)**,** [**0x**](https://0x.org/)**,** [**dYdX**](https://dydx.exchange/)**,** [**Dharma**](https://www.dharma.io/)**,** [**PoolTogether**](https://www.pooltogether.com/)**,** [**UMA**](https://umaproject.org/)**,** [**Lightning Labs**](https://lightning.engineering/)**,** [**River Financial**](https://river.com/)**,** [**Celo**](https://celo.org/)**,** [**Celer**](https://www.celer.network/)**,** [**Optimism**](https://optimism.io/)**,** [**MyCrypto**](https://mycrypto.com/)**,** [**DappHero**](https://www.dapphero.io/)**,** [**DeFiZap**](https://defizap.com/)**, and many more.**

Since its inception IDEO has helped DeFi founders from around the world to accelerate product/protocol market fit. The hands-on design research approach consists of user research (peers, experts and mentors in DeFi Community), interviews ( to gather key insight) and user result synthesis. Based on results IDEO helps team test product hypotheses that could be validated (or invalidated in many cases), resulting in a decision to pivot, pursue, or kill the idea.

We are thankful to **DeFi Dad (COO, Zapper.fi), Edgar (Co-Founder and CEO of Eventornado), Dennison Bertram (Founder of DappHero)** in joining the EPNS team for user interview and feedback for PVD.

Upon completion of the event, Harsh Rajat, founder of EPNS said

> 30 brilliant DeFi teams and the amazing team at IDEO came together for Product Validation Day yesterday. We, EPNS, got some great insights from our users and are so excited to keep learning and #BUIDLing

Awesome DeFi Teams kicking off PVD!!

IDEO PVD is an amazing hands-on approach that all blockchain startups can imbibe as part of their product discovery and design strategy. We are thankful to Ian, Sida, Dan Elitzer and the amazing IDEO CoLab team for sharing their invaluable experience with us.

Finally, as Dan mentioned during the IDEO PVD session.
