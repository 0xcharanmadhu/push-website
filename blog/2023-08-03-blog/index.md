We recently released an [article](https://push-protocol.medium.com/new-push-yield-farming-rewards-full-details-4a9ff473226d) extensively discussing the details of our new staking programs of the Push V2 Rewards Program includingâ€¦

1. <b>UNI-V2 LP Token Staking</b>: Similar to v1 incentive program, this procedure allows users to stake their UNI-V2 LP tokens in our staking contract and earn $PUSH tokens as a reward.
2. <b>Push Fee Pool Staking</b>: The second procedure is the new staking feature of the Push Core V2 smart contract that allows users to directly stake in the core contract itself and earn rewards in $PUSH Tokens generated from the Fee Pool.

In this article, we will now walk you through the specific steps for both the UNI-V2 LP pool and the Push Fee Staking pool:

- <i>How to Stake and Unstake Tokens</i>
- <i>How to Harvest your rewards</i>
- How to Migrate your tokens (from the Old Staking pools to the New V2 Rewards Program, with just one click)

For each of these steps, we will first talk about the ðŸ”´ Push Fee Staking Pool and then the ðŸŸ£ UNI-V2 LP Token Staking Pool
