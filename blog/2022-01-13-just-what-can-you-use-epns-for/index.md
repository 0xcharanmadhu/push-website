We‚Äôre pretty excited that the [EPNS mainnet has launched](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/the-epns-mainnet-is-here-470faec0c01). But behind all the celebration, we know you may be asking: ‚ÄúSo what now? How do I actually start using EPNS today?‚Äù Well, we have a lot more updates in our roadmap, but here‚Äôs a look of precisely how you can use EPNS starting this very moment, whether you‚Äôre a crypto investor, DeFi degen, developer, journalist, or just a curious cat.

All the fun happens at [app.epns.io](http://app.epns.io). There, under ‚ÄòChannels‚Äô, you‚Äôll find a list of all the live channels and descriptions of what kinds of notifications you‚Äôll receive if you opt-in. So let‚Äôs dive in:

# EPNS for DeFi üí∞

Right now, you can subscribe to receive notifications from the top DeFi projects in the space. Notifications are sent for either liquidation dangers or governance updates.

The **MakerDAO** channel sends notifications whenever there are new governance proposals.

The **Crypto Volatility Index (CVI)** channel sends out notifications about market volatility to protect LPs from impermanent loss.

The **Bancor** channel notifies users when liquidity mining campaigns begin or near closure, and notifies subscribers about new governance proposals.

The **Oasis** channel notifies subscribers when their vaults are reaching a high risk of liquidation.

The **Mover** channel notifies you about your yield harvested on the platform.

# EPNS for Domains and Governance üñ•

Never miss an update from some of the leading protocols in Web3 offering critical consumer applications and infrastructure.

The **ENS** channel notifies users when their domains are about to expire. No more needing to set manual calendar reminders!

The **Snapshot** channel notifies you when governance proposals are made from the projects you follow on Snapshot.

# EPNS for Traders and Investors üìà

All the information you need to trade and invest intelligently, delivered to an EPNS inbox near you.

The **ETH Tracker** and **BTC Tracker** channels notify subscribers every 6 hours of the token prices.

The **ETH Gas Tracker** channel tells users when ETH gas prices hit new highs, letting you more intelligently place those trades.

# EPNS for Media and News üóû

We‚Äôre proud to have partnered with **CoinDesk** to launch the first media channel on EPNS. Users will be notified whenever a news story goes live.

And there you have it! And yet, that‚Äôs only the beginning. Expect a lot more channels and notifications to go live in the days, weeks, and months to come. Let‚Äôs #PUSH it!
