# **EPNS Governance:**

We human being is social animal who enjoys communicating and exchanging ideas, each one having unique ideas and opinion that mostly leads to chaos. It’s a bit difficult to come up with a solution, in short, we need a democratized way of voting or a leader to take account of this.

So, we at EPNS have our own Governance mechanism to put proposals, vote, and be a part of the community. If you wanna learn more about the proposal lifecycle, rules & roles of EPNS Governance, refer to the article [**here**](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-governance-goes-live-lets-push-for-progressive-decentralized-governance-7448b58b89b4). Also, have a look at the overview of the first EPNS Proposal which got approved on Snapshot [**here**](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/epns-governance-goes-live-lets-push-for-progressive-decentralized-governance-7448b58b89b4).

In the first iteration of EPNS Governance, Snapshot voting is the final phase of a proposal in which the community could signal their interests on each proposal using delegated $PUSH votes. If you want to know more about how you can vote on Snapshot, follow the instructions below.
