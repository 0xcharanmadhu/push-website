<!--truncate-->

With the ever-evolving growth of on-chain governance, there’s never been a more critical time to address the coalesce need for progressive decentralization, safe asset management ([Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/)) and off-chain-voting on projects. Towards this effort, [GnosisDAO](https://gnosis.io/gnosisdao/) has created a tool that can execute community governance proposals in a decentralized manner, SafeSnap.

We’re excited to be one of Gnosis’s SafeSnap launch partners. In future, we’re looking forward to using SafeSnap in the EPNS ecosystem to allow greater fluidity in governance.

Gnosis’s SafeSnap brings on-chain execution to off-chain voting outcomes, via a Gnosis Safe module connected to [Reality.eth](https://reality.eth.link/) (an escalation-game-based oracle). This results in avoiding needless gas costs for on-chain voting, secure assets in Gnosis Safe and a phased approach towards decentralization.
