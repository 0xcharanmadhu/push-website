Really excited to be here with you! We’re doing a few talks, a couple of events, & of course excited to work with all you amazing BUIDLers in one of the coolest cities in Europe!

Excited to be here in Amsterdam at #Devconnect!

April kicked off really well for all of us at **EPNS**!

It’s been an amazing last week as we announced our **Series A Funding of $10 million** to continue building out the communication infrastructure for the decentralised future.

As we do that, it’s time for us to pack our bags all over again for we can’t wait for a big splash that is about to happen at Devconnect 2022!

This week-long in-person gathering with a focus on some in-depth sessions, collaborations through our hackathon, and of course some really depth-first sessions we’re part of with our team doing a few workshops.

It is a great time for us to PUSH for #Web3Comm and also meet some of the most amazing and passionate BUIDLers, Partners and frens across the Web3 ecosystem and have a great time at the event as well!

Here’s what we’re up to at Devconnect. Excited to meet y’all

Oh and did we mention, there’s a ton of merch, and of course prizes up for grabs from the EPNS team for the hackathon!
