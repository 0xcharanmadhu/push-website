Unstoppable domain .crypto domain support

Weâ€™re happy to announce our partnership with [Unstoppable Domains](https://unstoppabledomains.com/)! Ethereum Push Notification Service (EPNS) has integrated **.crypto** domains to the EPNS products (app and dApp) and will be working with UnstoppableDomains to explore various synergies between us in the future!

Whatâ€™s the deal?
================

*   Using the EPNS protocol, any dApp, service or smart contract can send notifications to users (wallet addresses) in a platform agnostic way (mobile, tablet, web, fav. wallets, etc).
*   With [Unstoppable Domains](https://get.unstoppabledomains.com/epns/), you can replace any long wallet address with a domain name as simple as \[YourName\].crypto.
*   Enjoy receiving real time Web3 alerts to any activity related to your easy-to-remember blockchain domain!

Awesome! So how does it work?
=============================

*   In this example, using _harsh.crypto_, we will explore notifications delivered to one of the many platforms â€” EPNS mobile app.
*   Download EPNS app from [AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/app/ethereum-push-service-epns/id1528614910) or [Google PlayStore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.epns.epns).
*   Get your .crypto domain from [Unstoppable Domains](https://get.unstoppabledomains.com/epns/).
*   Sign-up for EPNS by using your new .crypto name (scan via QR code or enter .crypto wallet address manually).

*   Setup a passcode for app security

*   Your setup is now complete.
*   Get ready to receive sweet sweet decentralized notifications on your .**crypto** domain! Yayyyyy!
