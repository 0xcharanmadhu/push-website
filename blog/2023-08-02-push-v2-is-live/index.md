We’re thrilled to announce the launch of Push V2!🎉


This new release is packed with exciting features that collectively delivers an unparalleled experience for our users, provides new tools for builders, and helps us take a huge leap forward in the way of democratizing web3 communication.

Here’s everything included:

### New Yield Farming Rewards via Push Fee Pool Staking🌾
With Push V2, we are empowering $PUSH token holders like never before by introducing 2 new staking pools as part of a brand-new Yield Farming Rewards Program.

One of which is the <i>Push Fee Pool</i> which collects fees for actions across Push Notifications, Channel-related actions, and Chat. By staking your $PUSH liquidity into the pool, you’ll be able to earn a portion of the fees collected from the protocol!

### Incentivized Chat 💬
Introduces the possibility to implement a one-time fee for receiving chat requests. With the introduction of this feature, users will gain enhanced control over incoming chat requests and get to say goodbye to ads and spam.

### Push Spaces 🌌
Welcome to the web3 version of Twitter Spaces. Engage in real-time, voice-based conversations with like-minded individuals and thought leaders. Create, host, and join Spaces on whatever topics you like natively on web3.

### Customized Profile Pictures 🖼️
Personalize your Push dApp profile with unique avatars that best represent your individuality and style. Total customization, total control.

## Democratizing web3 communication via a circular economy
The future of web3 communication is here, and it’s called Push V2.

All the features we’ve introduced in Push V2 are in the way of empowering users, rewarding participation, and hence creating a circular economy. In this way, we are democratizing web3 communication and giving control of web3’s leading communication layer to its stakeholders.

Additionally, our new features and functionality are expanding the universe of dApp UX enhancement even further. We are extremely excited to explore the possibilities of new integrations and dApps that these new features will enable.

Stay tuned for more updates and announcements on each of these features! ✨
