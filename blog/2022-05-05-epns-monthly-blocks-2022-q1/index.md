# Development üèóÔ∏è

Following a very high intensity pace in the development front, many moving pieces are coming together quite nicely and even ahead of time üòé.

## PUSH Nodes

Lots and lots of research and brainstorming took place this month around the decentralization of the PUSH Nodes. Many POCs have been worked on to ensure an efficient and highly scalable solution, and the first draft of the architecture is in the making!

## Wallet to Wallet

One of hottest items in our 2022 roadmap have been getting a ton of work. Same as with PUSH Nodes, our Dev team put big effort to make sure a solid design is built. Endless research, analysis, and design sessions allowed us to finalize the Architecture Design phase.

As you can see, May is poised to be a month full of great news in the development front. Again, we take the opportunity to invite all builders to join us in our Discord to help build the Communication Layer of the Web 3 together!

And to finalize, a call to all of you developers looking to join us! We are still hiring! Reach out to us if interested.
