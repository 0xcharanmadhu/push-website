<!--truncate-->

EPNS and Azuro, the decentralized betting protocol join forces in a collaboration to enable direct communication between users and the protocol. As a result, users of the protocol are poised to receive push notifications about various happenings on the protocol. These notifications will allow users to grab opportunities on Azuro and encourage participation.

### Azuro: Bringing Fair and Transparent Betting to the Blockchain
Azuro is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that is focused on redefining betting on the blockchain through innovation and democratization. Azuro addresses the lack of transparency and negative incentives that plague today’s online betting scene and aims to provide a viable solution for the same.

Azuro uses smart contracts at the core of the protocol to build innovative solutions for allocation and liquidity provision in betting. The protocol promises full transparency and instant payouts for its users combined with an unmatched user experience. Moreover, Azuro breaks down the role of a bookmarker into several smaller roles to allow everyone to benefit from it. This makes the process of betting fun, transparent, safe, and affordable for users of Azuro, eliminating the negative connotations of betting.

As a protocol focused on transparency at its core, Azuro needs a decentralized communication channel to keep its users informed and updated at all times. This is where the collaboration with EPNS becomes crucial.

### What Does the Collaboration Entail
As a result of the collaboration between EPNS and Azuro, Azuro will explore the possibilities of creating an official channel on the EPNS platform that its users can subscribe to. In doing so, users would be able to receive decentralized push notifications informing them about various happenings on the protocol, meaning users could take full advantage of the opportunities as and when they arise. EPNS has a chrome extension along with a mobile application and a decentralized application to ensure that users don’t miss out on important notifications.

As Azuro is working towards making betting safe and transparent, we at EPNS are pleased to team up with them and hope to become an integral part of their operations.

### About Azuro
Azuro is a decentralized betting protocol with DAO governance, designed to become the base infrastructure of betting dApps in the future. Azuro’s solution revolves around two important new pillars — importing odds & results via oracles, and utilizing 1 main liquidity pool, from where liquidity is allocated to different events and markets based on popularity.
