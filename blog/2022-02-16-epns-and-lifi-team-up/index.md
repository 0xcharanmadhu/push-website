Despite its monumental success over the past couple of years, the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry still largely remains to be fragmented. Every blockchain network within the industry seems to have created walled gardens for themselves that make it difficult for users to bypass. As a result, users are usually stuck with funds on a single blockchain network, preventing them from taking advantage of opportunities across different chains.

This creates a lackluster user experience, hindering the full potential of DeFi and thereby its mainstream adoption. Having recognized this problem, Li.Fi, an emergent DeFi protocol, created a robust way for users to experience interoperability within DeFi. As such, we’re pleased to announce our pilot collaboration with Li.Fi to provide a means of communication between the protocol and users.

### How Li.Fi Can Benefit from EPNS

Li.Fi is a cross-chain bridge aggregator protocol that allows users to swap any token for another, irrespective of their native blockchain networks. The protocol chooses the best possible bridge to move funds from one chain to the other by connecting to DEXs on both sides. This means that by simply integrating the Li.Fi SDK and API, dApps and protocols in DeFi can allow users to bypass the walled gardens of blockchain networks to conduct transactions.

Using Li.Fi, users will be able to take advantage of superior yield farming, staking, and investment opportunities across the DeFi ecosystem without having to constantly move from one chain to the other. This contributes to an overall better user experience for both new and veteran users and brings the fragmented DeFi space closer together, paving the way for mainstream adoption.

Now, given that users of Li.Fi can conduct multiple cross-chain transactions, it is quite a laborious task for them to manually check for transaction confirmations. Li.Fi needs a communication channel through which it can directly update users about the status of their transactions. This is where EPNS comes into play.

What Does the Collaboration Entail
==================================

Through our pilot partnership with Li.Fi, we aim to provide a way for the protocol to seamlessly communicate with its users without depending on external media. Users of Li.Fi will directly receive push notifications about the status of their transactions through bridges. Instead of them having to check time and again, the protocol will notify users when their assets are successfully bridged to the other side. This saves users a lot of time and effort and improves their overall user experience within DeFi.

As Li.Fi strives to bridge the gaps between blockchain networks, we are pleased to have partnered with them on this journey and hope to be an integral part of their operations.

### About Li.Fi

Li.Fi is a cross-chain bridge aggregation protocol that supports any-2-any cross-chain swaps by aggregating bridges and connecting them to DEXes and DEX aggregators.

In a nutshell, we’re like 1inch & Paraswap for bridges, we choose the best bridge to move funds from one chain to another, but since bridges only support stable-coins and a few other coins, we have DEXes on both sides of the bridges to swap before and after the bridge, thus facilitating any-2-any swaps across chains.
