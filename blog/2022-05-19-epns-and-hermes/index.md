<!--truncate-->

EPNS and Hermes DeFi, an advanced DEX/AMM with novel defi primitives on the Harmony blockchain, have teamed up in a pilot collaboration to bring Web3 push notifications for users. As such, Hermes DeFi will now be able to seamlessly interact with its users and keep them updated about the various investment and governance opportunities on the platform without reliance on Web2 social media platforms.

#### Hermes DeFi: The Olympus of DeFi
Hermes DeFi defines itself as the “Olympus of DeFi”. With a team of 16 experienced DeFi users, Hermes is building an entire suite of DeFi applications surrounding a low-cost and efficient DEX/AMM on the Harmony blockchain. They have received almost $500,000 in investments from [Harmony](https://hermesdefi.medium.com/what-a-305k-investment-in-hermes-defi-looks-like-96b7bb4f534) and [Momentum 6](https://blog.hermesdefi.io/hermes-defi-receives-a-175-000-investment-for-their-trader-focused-dex-launching-on-harmony-9f25dd99b6f7) to build a trader-focused and user-friendly DeFi system on [Harmony](https://www.harmony.one/).

<b>The Hermes Protocol</b> is a collection of DeFi tools that helps to bring ease of use and better insights into your crypto portfolio. On launch, you’ll be able to enjoy a [0.2% swap fee](https://docs.hermesdefi.io/tokenomics/feenomics) with efficient routing across 13 tokens. Hermes is offering both regular Farms and [Dual Farms](https://docs.hermesdefi.io/partnerships/dual-farms), which can reward two tokens with no reward lockups. Farmed HRMS can be staked as [sHRMS](https://docs.hermesdefi.io/hermes-products/shrms) or [xHRMS](https://docs.hermesdefi.io/hermes-products/xhrms), which automatically collect a portion of protocol fees and payout in USDC or HRMS, respectively. These features, combined with an in-depth analytics system, are just the start for Hermes DeFi. Their [roadmap for 2022](https://docs.hermesdefi.io/the-hermes-protocol/roadmap) includes: trustless liquid staking of ONE tokens (hONE), Bonding, Limit Orders, and much more.

### What Does the Collaboration Entail
As a result of this pilot collaboration, Hermes DeFi will have an official channel housed on the EPNS platform. Users of Hermes DeFi will be able to subscribe to this channel to receive:

- Price alerts
- Updates about new bond cycles, new dual farms opening or dual farms closing
- Updates about governance proposals
- Notifications about reward thresholds when they are ready to claim.
- …and more in the future!

This saves users the hassle of manually checking for all these updates and improves the user experience on the platform along with the participation rates. We’re excited to dive into this alliance with Hermes DeFi and hope to contribute to the growth of the platform.
