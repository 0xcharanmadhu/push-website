There have been very special moments though our journey that leave a mark in our hearts, and this month the **EPNS Mainnet launch** is one of them. It was an incredible start for this year. This EPNS Monthly Blocks edition comes packed with a multitude of news in all fronts. Let’s dive into it!

# Mainnet Launch 🚀

The Launch date was set: **January 11th.** #PUSHforMainnet Mode: **ON**!  
The entire Team was laser-focused on making this release a success, and it required orchestrating several moving pieces.

Finally, after months and months of preparation at 4PM UTC on January 11th [EPNS was successfully launched on Mainnet](https://medium.com/ethereum-push-notification-service/the-epns-mainnet-is-here-470faec0c01).

After launching with 15 channels during the Mainnet launch week, we end the month with 30+ channels and over 40.000 users subscriptions to receive notifications from their favorite protocols and services.

Looking forward for a great month ahead after even more channels are launched!

# Development 🏗️

This month several tasks took place in the development front not only in preparation for Mainnet launch, but also to set a foundation for all the amazing things coming in our 2022 roadmap.

- Extensive verification & validation of every component of the EPNS ecosystem took place before the big day as dry-runs to ensure a flawless deployment: testing of migration scripts, dry-runs for deployment, stress testing, and more.
- We set ourselves the task to produce User Journey videos for every channel we were launching as a part of our mainnet launch activities. These are short videos aiming to explain users how they can subscribe and receive notification from their favorite channels.
- Introduced the off-chain notifications ⚙️ , allowing services to send notifications without any gas fees. Together with Channels visualization 📰 based on verification and subscribers is LIVE!
- Subset notifications in the works, and making good solid progress.
- EPNS on Polygon planning and development activities in progress! 🔥
- Spam Box in the browser extension 📮 dev activities started!

Additionally, we released our [**EPNS Roadmap 2022**](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1485673774510796801?s=20&t=nFDC9CXOStcai9Ph2CyEzg) together with our guide for Developers on [**How to get started with EPNS (for Devs!)**](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1485976070008360961?s=20&t=nFDC9CXOStcai9Ph2CyEzg)

# Governance 🗳️

Governance started the year with awesome traction, great news, and more engagement from the community.

This month we announced two very important proposals aiming to allow for more community members to participate and bring more awareness of EPNS to the entire space.

- [**Incentives Proposal**](https://twitter.com/epnsproject/status/1479556336551563269?s=20): looking to create more meaningful participation from the community, and incentivize all proposals that make it to the finish line!
