From the get-go, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have served as a popular way to pool and swap liquidity within the DeFi ecosystem. Projects in DeFi found a substantial way of generating the needed liquidity through yield farming and mining programs. However, when compared to centralized exchanges, DEXs appear to be quite limited in what they can do. Emergent DeFi startups and projects still find it difficult to pool initial startup funding and market entry liquidity on DEXs.

To solve this issue and help DeFi projects raise enough initial liquidity in a decentralized manner, Poolz Finance introduced a robust mechanism for new projects to raise funds through cross-chain liquidity auctions. In this regard, we at EPNS are pleased to announce our pilot collaboration with the protocol to enable direct communication with its users.

### How Poolz Finance Can Benefit from EPNS

Poolz Finance is a swapping protocol and IDO launchpad that aims to revolutionize fund-raising in DeFi. It essentially allows startups and new DeFi protocols to auction their tokens on the platform for bootstrapping liquidity. Poolz Finance features highly customizable pool options to cater to a wide range of DeFi projects with varying use cases, and supports multichain integrations. Moreover, the platform also helps nascent startups with pre-listings, bringing them close to early investors.

For investors, Poolz Finance provides a way to invest in the growth of early-stage projects. As such, it is essential for the protocol to constantly stay in touch with its users, keeping them updated about new IDO, pool launches, and whitelisting updates. Through our pilot collaboration with Poolz Finance, we aim to create a medium for direct communication between users and the protocol through push notifications.

# What Does the Collaboration Entail

As a result of this strategic collaboration, Poolz Finance will have an official channel on the EPNS platform. Users of Poolz Finance can subscribe to this channel to allow the protocol to directly communicate with them. They can expect to receive updates whenever a new liquidity pool is created on the platform and whenever a new token is available to claim. This alleviates the need for users to manually check the protocol for IDO launches, in turn saving them a lot of time and effort.

As Poolz Finance strives towards fostering innovative startups for DeFi, weâ€™re pleased to partner with them on this ambitious journey. In the near future, we may explore further synergies with Poolz Finance to help keep its users in the loop with everything that happens on the platform.
