Ethereum Push Notification Service is proud to announce that we’ve formed a strategic partnership with Frontier.

[Frontier](https://frontier.xyz/) is a chain-agnostic DeFi aggregator that enables users to manage all of their DeFi applications and assets in a safe, simple portal. Frontier’s platform is blockchain-agnostic and currently supports multiple DeFi protocols, including Uniswap, Aave, Compound and MakerDAO.

Our pilot collaboration with Frontier will ensure that we brainstorm with their team to implement our protocol and decentralized push notifications on their wallet. This will enable us to take one step further in building the communication layer of Ethereum and Web3 as a whole.

Our pilot program with Frontier will consist of:

*   Exploring protocol usage within Frontier app.
*   Implementing and ironing out any features required to enable smooth integration.
*   Working with the Frontier team to enable technical discussions towards building a SDK that is deployable as a plug and play solution for all crypto wallets.
*   Possible integration with Frontier wallet in the future.

We are honored to be working with the Frontier team. With the growing horizons of DeFi across protocols and chains, we are excited to be part of one of the best projects that greatly enhanced user experience and simplified DeFi usage for all the users!

Decentralized Notifs FTW!!
