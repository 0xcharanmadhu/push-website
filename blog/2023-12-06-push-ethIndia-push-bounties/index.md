### ETHIndia Hackers ⸺  Ready, Set, Code! 🛠️
We’re going all-in with a whopping $10,000 in bounties for 13 prize winners spread across 4 bounty categories. No matter what you plan on building, we have both a web3-native communication tool and bounty waiting for you.

Here’s the breakdown of all the prizes:

#### 1. 🏆 Namaste Push Protocol ⸺ $1,500


<b>Number of winners: 1</b>


Before it was GM GM, this week it’s "Namaste!" 


This bounty celebrates the best use of Push Protocol in social-based DApps. From leveraging Push Notifications for vital alerts to exploring Notification settings for customization, and integrating chat functionality with the power of conditional gating – this is your chance to make a meaningful impact by merging social initiatives with technology.


Here are a few ideas for inspiration:
- <b>SocialImpactHub</b>: A DApp dedicated to social activists, where users can receive notifications about upcoming rallies or events. Consider using conditional gating to enable activists with specific badges or tokens to access private planning rooms.
- <b>EcoAlert</b>: An environmental initiative platform where users can chat about sustainable practices and get notified about eco-friendly events or sudden environmental crises.
- <b>CommunityCare</b>: A local community dApp where neighbors can communicate in real time, set up events, and receive notifications about local emergencies or activities. With conditional gating, special groups could be set up for neighborhood committees or watch groups.
- <b>PushForChange</b>: A fundraising platform that sends out notifications about new charitable campaigns. Users can chat with charity organizers and use conditional gating to access exclusive fundraising events based on their donation history.

The "Namaste Push Protocol" Prize is all about acknowledging the innovative spirit of developers who want to make a meaningful impact in the world using Push Protocol.

#### 3. 🏆 Push Chat Conditional Gating Integration for DApps ⸺ $1,500

<b>Number of winners: 1</b>


Showcase the potential of Push by integrating its Conditional Gating feature into your dApps. Conditional Gating is a feature that allows you to create dynamic and sophisticated permissions for your Group Chats. You can set unique conditions for both joining or messaging in the groups such as needing to hold a certain amount of token XYZ or be a holder of XYZ NFT.


Your task? Integrate the Push Chat Conditional Gating feature in your dApp, utilizing at least two of the following use cases: 


- Token-gated groups
- NFT-gated groups
- Multi-chain conditions
- Sending message conditions 
- Non-web3 conditions using Guild 
- Game theories by combining multiple conditions
- Ensure smooth UX/UI and seamless user verification based on the set rules


For more information regarding Conditional Gating and Rules for Group Chats, checkout our documentation here 👉https://push.org/docs/chat/build/conditional-rules-for-group/

#### 4. 🏆 BUIDL Together (Pool Prize) ⸺ $5,000

<b>Number of winners: 10</b>
