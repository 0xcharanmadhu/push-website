Decentralized finance (DeFi) is a major part of the Web3 ecosystem. Led by crypto pioneers and enthusiasts, we are witnessing the emergence of this new open global financial infrastructure. Meanwhile institutions and non crypto native users are also now participating in DeFi and they require tools to match the user experience of Web2 tools and smartphone apps.

In this context, we are delighted to announce our pilot collaboration with Aave, the leading decentralized liquidity protocol. Our collaboration with Aave is also an opportunity for us to enhance the EPNS protocol and create a robust standard for decentralized notifications.

Our collaboration and pilot program with Aave is two faceted:

1.  Our first goal is to develop a notification standard that meets the demanding requirements of DeFi liquidity protocol users. Aave users will be able subscribe to alerts such as the risk of being liquidated, decline in health factor of their loan, borrow or deposit rate exceeding preset thresholds, new assets becoming available for borrowing, governance proposals being approved and so on.
2.  Secondly, Aaveâ€™s highly experienced team will provide expert input to improve scalability, security, usability and adoption of EPNS.

Aave has played a foundational role in giving shape to the DeFi ecosystem as it stands today. We are delighted to have the opportunity to work alongside Aave and shape the future of DeFi.

For more updates on our journey as we transform DeFi and push notifications, stay tuned.
